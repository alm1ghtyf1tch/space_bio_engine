    "Results": "2.1. The asparagine pathway and extracellular asparagine and glutamine concentrations are affected by simulated microgravity treatment of S. marcescens Our previous findings have indicated that S. marcescens exposed to LSMMG for 24 h grow at a faster rate inside the host after infection and caused increased host lethality in D.melanogaster [ 11 ]. First, we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control bacteria ( Table 3 ). We, therefore, looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms and found that genes related to asparagine metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG. More specifically, we found that there was a significant upregulation in asnB (asparagine synthetase B), which is a gene that regulates the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine ( Figure 1 A,B). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of genes that are important for asparagine and glutamine metabolism. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression level of the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B) was 39.17 fold higher in LSMMG-treated cells relative to the RWV-control (P < 0.0001), as well as a 10.5 fold increase in expression of L-asparaginase ( L-ap , P = 0.054), but there was no significant difference in expression for the other genes tested, although several genes showed a positive trend for expression levels: L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase) ( Figure 1 D). asnB is a gene that catalyzes the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine, and is known to be linked to virulence and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens [ 36 , 37 ]. The L-asparaginase subunits assist with asparagine catabolism and nitrogen homeostasis [ 39 ], therefore, an overexpression of these genes suggests that there is an increase in asparagine catabolism as part of the overall homeostatic regulation of the asparagine pathway. Table 3. Expression values of candidate genes in S. marcescens for growth, motility, and virulence as measured by qPCR. Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to RWV-Control and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Samples were grown in the RWV for 24 h, then fixed in RNAlater for extraction. Samples were run with three technical replicates per plate, and were performed in three biological replicates. Values reported are the average across all replicates.

Measurements of amino acid consumption were performed by removing cells from media by centrifugation and utilizing spectrophotometric analysis with Megazyme™ reagent. A) The asparagine biosynthesis pathway. B) At the end of the growth period of S. marcescens in simulated microgravity (LSMMG orientation), gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR: L-ap (L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), asnB (asparagine synthetase B), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change relative to the RWV-Control orientation and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Specific genes represented by the blue end of the color spectrum indicated gene overexpression and those towards the red end indicated inhibition of gene expression. Error bars represent one standard error. Measurements of C) extracellular asparagine and D) extracellular glutamine were performed at hours 0, 6, and 14 of growth in the rotating wall vessel, with an initial starting concentration of 1 × 10 8 CFU. The observation that asnB expression is significantly increased, led us to hypothesize that there is an increased presence of asparagine in LSMMG that may contribute to the increase in pathogen growth rate, and therefore an increase in consumption of glutamine and aspartate in the media. To confirm this, we quantified the rates at which S. marcescens utilized extracellular glutamine and asparagine in the nutrient-rich LB media, in order to see whether the consumption rates of these amino acids matched the increased growth of the bacteria in LSMMG. For asparagine measurements ( Figure 1 C), there was no difference between the RWV-control and the LSMMG at 0 h (F = 4.348, P = 0.11) or at 14 h (F = 0.007, P = 0.939). At 6 h of growth, LSMMG had significantly lower extracellular asparagine than the RWV-Control (F = 1540.68, P < 0.0001). Similarly, extracellular glutamine ( Figure 1 D) was not significantly different at hours 0 (F = 2.251, P = 0.208) or 14 (F = 0.669, P = 0.459), but LSMMG had significantly lower glutamine at hour 6 (F = 282.056, P < 0.0001). These results suggest that the S. marcescens in LSMMG are consuming extracellular glutamine and asparagine more quickly during the active growth phase of the culture, which is consistent with the increase in growth that we see in LSMMG-reared bacteria in rich media [ 11 ]. Taken together, the almost 40-fold overexpression of the asnB gene in LSMMG coupled with the overexpression of the asparaginase subunits ( Figure 1 B), along with the increased consumption of asparagine ( Figure 1 C), indicated that the asparagine pathway was likely to play a significant role in the phenotypic changes observed in S. marcescens under reduced gravity LSMMG conditions. 2.2. S. marcescens growth is affected by L-asparaginase treatment in vitro under simulated microgravity conditions Since we saw an increase in asparagine consumption with LSMMG treatment, we studied whether the depletion of exogenous L-asparagine using the enzyme L-asparaginase would negatively influence growth in LSMMG. When S. marcescens was grown in LSMMG with asparaginase, growth was significantly lower than the LSMMG without asparaginase at hours 18 (P = 0.034), 21 (P = 0.0004), and 24 (P = 0.0008) of growth ( Figure 2 B). For the RWV-Control sample, asparaginase reduced growth only at hour 15 (P = 0.031), but not at any other timepoints. The LSMMG + asparaginase growth was significantly lower than the RWV-Control at hour 18 (P = 0.0296) but was not significantly different from the control at any other time point ( Figure 2 B). These results provide evidence that L-asparaginase reduces the growth of S. marcescens in the LSMMG condition compared to the control, but does not significantly impact growth in the control samples, suggesting that the growth-suppressive effect of L-asparaginase is LSMMG-specific. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Exogenously added L-asparaginase can inhibit growth of LSMMG-treated bacteria and reduce host-lethality. A) The breakdown of asparagine catalyzed by the asparaginase enzyme. B) The starting concentration of 1 × 10 8 CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37 °C in LB media. One hundred microliters of L-asparaginase was added to the growth media, and growth of bacteria estimated by absorbance at 600 nm was measured every 3 h. L-asparaginase addition in vitro reduces the rate of growth most significantly in the LSMMG samples. Error bars represent one standard error. C and D) Bacteria were grown in RWV with LB media only. After 24 h of growth, bacteria were fixed in 20% glycerol for injections. Flies were injected with S. marcescens . One hour after infection, flies were then injected with a treatment of L-asparaginase, or sterile water (no treatment). The LSMMG bacteria kills flies at a lower rate when L-asparaginase is injected in vivo (C) and similarly in vivo injected L-asparaginase does not impact survival of the RWV-Control (D). (The statistical results for the comparisons shown in Figures 2C and 2D are included in Table 1 .) 2.3. Injection of LSMMG S. marcescens with in vivo L-asparaginase treatment reduces lethality in the D. melanogaster host Next, since the synthesis of asparagine by S. marcescens was closely linked with LSMMG treatment, we investigated whether L-asparaginase could mitigate increased virulence of LSMMG-reared pathogens after injection into a host as measured by host mortality. To do this, LSMMG or RWV-Control-treated S. marcescens were injected into D. melanogaster hosts, and the infected hosts were then injected again with L-asparaginase 1 h after bacterial infection. There was no difference in overall fly survival between the LSMMG and the LSMMG + asparaginase treatment in the early part of the survival curve indicating that there was no harmful effect from asparaginase injections of the host ( Figure 2 C, P = 0.0976). However, when the survival curve was analyzed for the latter half of the experiment (12–24 h) when the majority of the host death typically occurs from an S. marcescens infection, then there was a significant difference in survival with and without asparaginase treatment. We demonstrated that the LSMMG-injected flies died faster than the LSMMG with asparaginase treatment ( Figure 2 C, Risk Ratio = 2.92, P = 0.0197). There was no difference between the RWV-Control with water or with asparaginase ( Figure 2 D, Risk Ratio = 1.33, P = 0.348). For the complete result of this statistical analysis, please see Table 1 . These results indicate that the addition of exogenous asparaginase into the host, during infection with S. marcescens, can inhibit the increased S. marcescens virulence that is associated with reduced gravity treatment of the microbe ( Figure 2 C). L-asparaginase does not prevent host death and does not affect the time-course of host lethality in the RWV-Control bacteria ( Figure 2 D), but it does target the gravity-specific increase in host lethality by S. marcescens that we have shown in our previous study [ 11 ].

Both aspartate and glutamine supplementation in combination are required in minimal media to recapitulate the asparagine pathway gene expression changes seen in rich media Next, we examined the effect of specific amino acids that are substrates in the asparagine synthesis pathway, on bacterial growth kinetics and gene expression. To do this, we grew S. marcescens in a minimal media supplemented with glutamine, aspartate, or both amino acids together, in LSMMG and in the RWV-Control. For all amino acid growth measures, there was no significant difference between the LSMMG and RWV-Control S. marcescens , except for the aspartate-supplemented sample at 24 h ( Figure 3 D, F = 1.76, P = 0.0023). This suggests that aspartate in isolation is sufficient to stimulate the LSMMG-specific increase in growth. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Growth and gene expression changes of LSMMG-treated S. marcescens in Davis minimal media supplemented with amino acids. Starting concentration of 1 × 10 8 CFU of S. marcescens was placed in a 10 mL rotating wall vessel at 37 °C, containing A) Davis minimal media only, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine, and D) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate. Growth was measured every 24 h for 72 h. E) At the end of growth period, gene expression for each sample was measured via qPCR:: L-ap (L-asparaginase), L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), asnB (asparagine synthetase B), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). Expression values are reported as fold change in LSMMG relative to the Davis minimal media values and calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method. Even though aspartate addition increases growth in LSMMG cultures but asnB and L-ap genes are overexpressed in LSMMG compared to control only when both glutamine and aspartate are present. However, when we looked at how these growth conditions influenced gene expression, the expression level of 38.95 relative to the RWV-control was significantly higher for the gene asnB (asparagine synthetase B ) in the combined glutamine and aspartate supplemented media but not in the media with either glutamine or aspartate alone ( Figure 3 E, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the gene L-ap (L-asparaginase) with a relative expression value of 21.45 was significantly higher in the combined media than in the glutamine or aspartate media alone (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference across media conditions for the other genes tested: L-ap1 (L-asparaginase 1), L-ap2 (L-asparaginase 2), iaaA (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or astL (asparagine tRNA ligase). This suggests that while aspartate alone can increase the growth of S. marcescens in LSMMG in minimal media, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are necessary to induce the LSMMG-specific overexpression of asnB at a similar level to the nutrient-rich media ( Figure 1 B and Figure 3 E). 2.5. Maximal host mortality rates of D. melanogaster are seen only when minimal media is supplemented with aspartate and glutamine, substrates of asparagine synthesis Given the significantly increased expression of asnB in LSMMG-grown bacteria in minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, it was important to test whether bacteria grown in this way would also increase its virulence in the D. melanogaster host. In the minimal media supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine, flies injected with the bacteria grown in LSMMG died faster than those injected with bacteria grown in the RWV-Control (Ratio = 2.46, P = 0.0021, Figure 4 A). Similarly, the media with aspartate supplementation showed an increase in the rate of fly death after injection with the LSMMG-grown bacteria compared to the control (Ratio = 2.26, P = 0.007, Figure 4 B). For the LSMMG-grown bacteria, there was a greater rate of fly death from the bacteria grown in aspartate and glutamine media compared to the bacteria grown in aspartate alone (Ratio = 1.98, P = 0.0221, Figure 4 A,B). There is no significant difference in mortality rates between the flies injected with bacteria reared in LSMMG with a media composition composed of just the Davis minimal media (P = 0.46) or in the minimal media with just glutamine added (P = 0.55, Figure 4 C). The full results of these comparisons can be seen in Table 2 . This indicates that while either aspartate alone or both aspartate and glutamine together, can cause an increase in bacterial growth rate in vitro, only the combination of the two amino acids together can cause the LSMMG-specific induction of asnB expression and also causes the maximum increase in LSMMG-dependent virulence of the bacteria in terms of mortality of the fly host (Figures 3 and 4 ). In other words, the increased growth rate in the LSMMG is not a complete determinant for the increased virulence of S. marcescens , but that a change in the metabolism of nutrients like asparagine plays a critical role in the heightened mortality induced by gravity-treated bacteria on a host. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Infection of flies with S. marcescens shows maximum host mortality with LSMMG bacteria when supplemented with both aspartate and glutamine. Sample was grown in A) Davis minimal media (DMM) either alone or with 10 mM aspartate and 10 mM glutamine, B) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM aspartate, C) Davis minimal media supplemented with 10 mM glutamine. Bacteria were grown for 24 h in the RWV, then fixed in 20% glycerol for injections into D. melanogaster hosts. Both glutamine and aspartate must be present together to elicit the maximum LSMMG-induced increase in host mortality as shown in Figure 4 A. (The full statistical results for all comparisons can be seen in Table 2 .) Table 2.

    "Conclusion": "In this study, we provide evidence for the importance of nutrient utilization during bacterial growth as a factor for increased host mortality after pathogen growth in LSMMG. Host mortality is a direct measure of pathogen virulence, and therefore an increased rate of host death is one indication of increased virulence of a pathogen [ 40 ]. While there are studies showing an increase in virulence of pathogens after exposure to spaceflight and simulated microgravity, the specific mechanisms that underlie these changes are largely unknown. In our previous study [ 11 ], we found that S. marcescens in spaceflight and in LSMMG show an increase in virulence via increased rate of host mortality, and that the in vivo growth of the pathogen after infection of the host is higher from both spaceflight and LSMMG treated bacteria. While in vivo growth is only an indirect proxy for virulence, faster pathogen growth immediately following infection is often linked to the ability of the pathogen to overcome host immunity and sustain infection [ 41 , 42 ]. Therefore it was necessary for us to examine in more detail the specific potential mechanisms for increased virulence of S. marcescens in LSMMG. First we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control ( Table 3 ). We therefore looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms, and found that genes related to amino acid metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG ( Figure 1 B). We found that several genes within the asparagine synthesis pathway were overexpressed in LSMMG, but specifically saw the largest overexpression, an almost 40-fold increase, in the asparagine synthetase B ( asnB gene). Asparagine synthetase B is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine using aspartate, and glutamine as a nitrogen source [ 43 , 44 ]. The deletion of the asnB gene leads to a slow-growth phenotype in the pathogen Bacillus subtilis , and in most pathogens (including S. marcescens ) is the main gene involved in asparagine biosynthesis [ 45 ]. This gene has not been implicated previously in S. marcescens virulence, but has been shown to mediate virulence and resistance to drugs in other bacterial pathogens [ 36 , 37 ]. While this gene and others in amino acid uptake pathways are important for growth and division of the cell, they are also important mediators of host-pathogen interactions [ 38 ]. While the host utilizes amino acid metabolism to support defense responses against a pathogen, conversely, the pathogen can modulate amino acid metabolism for its own advantage [ 38 ]. Therefore, amino acid utilization and assimilation mechanisms can be important mediators of infection at the host-pathogen interface, and asparagine metabolism has been linked to virulence and resistance of some pathogens to antibiotics [ 36 , 37 , 38 ]. In this study we characterize the underlying indicators for the increased host mortality that we previously reported after infection with microgravity-treated S. marcescens [ 11 ]. We show that S. marcescens grown in LSMMG consume key amino acids glutamine and asparagine at a faster rate than the control ( Figure 1 C, D), suggesting that the LSMMG might be priming these pathogens to compete with responding host immune cells for extracellular amino acids necessary for proliferation. In fact, this is the method by which some pathogens are successful colonizers of their hosts. The virulence of pathogen Francisella tularensis is dependent on the pathogen's ability to replicate inside the host and escape from macrophages [ 46 ]. Asparagine acquisition is critical in this pathogen's success in replicating inside the host cell, where they use the host as a substrate for asparagine and aspartate necessary to replicate [ 46 ]. Similarly, S. marcescens has been shown to have the ability to survive and proliferate inside non-phagocytic host cells, suggesting that there may be a similar mechanism of host-pathogen competition for amino acids [ 47 ]. We see in our study that growth in LSMMG increases the expression of asnB ( Figure 1 B), implying an increased consumption of aspartate and glutamine to synthesize asparagine more efficiently, that may allow these pathogens to out-compete host immune cells for amino acids during infection. The presence of both aspartate and glutamine causes a significant overexpression of asnB , even when they are the only amino acids present in minimal media ( Figure 3 E). This suggests that these two amino acid substrates, which are both required for asparagine synthesis, are important for LSMMG-induced overexpression of asnB . Therefore, we believe that the LSMMG-induced increase in pathogen virulence may be mediated by the ability of S. marcescens to utilize asparagine more efficiently within the host after infection, although further studies are needed to evaluate how S. marcescens reared in LSMMG are specifically interacting with the host's immune cells. We also found evidence that there is an overexpression of some L-asparaginase subunits, including L-asparaginase ( Figure 3 E and Figure 1 B) when asnB is overexpressed in the presence of its substrates, aspartate and glutamine. The homeostatic maintenance of the asparagine pathway consists of the anabolic and catabolic processes catalyzed by asnB and L-ap respectively which could result in the upregulation of both enzymes with increased asparagine metabolism. In Salmonella typhimurium infections, it has been shown that L-asparaginase suppresses T-cell responses by suppressing T-cell blastogenesis, proliferation, and cytokine production in the host, and that this effect could be attenuated by treatment with L-asparagine [ 48 ]. This highlights the fact that asparagine can be a key amino acid both for mammalian immune responses to bacterial pathogens, and is also important for bacterial growth and virulence properties. In this study, we provide evidence that the asparagine pathway is a critical determinant of the LSMMG-dependent increase in host mortality induced by S. marcescens . While aspartate alone can increase in vitro growth of S. marcescens in an LSMMG-specific manner ( Figure 3 D), the combination of both aspartate and glutamine (substrates for asparagine synthesis) are required to cause the maximal increase in host lethality during the infection of D.melanogaster with LSMMG treated bacteria ( Figure 4 A). Similarly, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are required to elicit the full induction of asnB gene expression which is not seen with aspartate or glutamine addition alone ( Figure 3 E). Interestingly, these results indicate that increased division rate of the pathogen during the growth phase alone ( Figure 3 ) is not sufficient to recapitulate the full extent of host mortality observed after infection with microgravity-treated S. marcescens ( Figure 4 ). Therefore, the microgravity dependent increase in host mortality induced by S. marcescens , appears to be linked specifically with asparagine pathway function under LSMMG conditions, and cannot be fully accounted for simply by increasing bacterial growth rate with the addition of amino acid substrates. To further characterize the effect of the asparagine pathway, the direct suppression of the expression of asnB through controlled genetic mechanisms was not within the scope of this study. However, as mentioned above, we demonstrated that the attenuation of the asparagine pathway, via the absence of relevant amino acids from the growth media, suppresses the overexpression of asnB in LSMMG ( Figure 3 E) and correlates with increased host survival ( Figure 4 B,C). Additional studies that target asnB gene with a knockdown will be conducted in future. When we co-infect flies with both LSMMG-reared S. marcescens and exogenously-added purified L-asparaginase, we see a therapeutic effect, and the flies die at a significantly slower rate than the LSMMG-reared bacteria injected alone ( Figure 2 C). This is in line with our hypothesis that growth in LSMMG is priming S. marcescens with the ability to compete effectively with the host for asparagine utilization. The addition of L-asparaginase would break down extracellular asparagine, thereby diminishing the ability of the bacteria to out-compete the host's ability to utilize asparagine for its cellular processes. Consistent with this, L-asparaginase added to the growth medium causes suppression of S. marcescens growth, but only in LSMMG and not in the RWV-Control ( Figure 2 B). These results suggest that additional exogenous L-asparaginase has a detrimental effect on the pathogen itself and causes it to become less virulent in LSMMG, perhaps by reducing the amount of available asparagine that otherwise would have enhanced the LSMMG-treated microbe's ability to utilize this amino acid in the host's body. In growth media without the presence of exogenous L-asparaginase, the L-asparagine in the growth media is consumed at a significantly faster rate in LSMMG than in the RWV-Control ( Figure 1 C), and a similar effect is seen with the consumption of glutamine ( Figure 1 D). In some pathogens, mutants lacking the ability to synthesize glutamine or to acquire glutamine from the host, show attenuated virulence, since this is an important source of nitrogen assimilation during colonization of the pathogen in the host [ 49 , 50 ]. These studies further support the idea that amino acids that are critical for several cellular processes, including protein synthesis, can also be important for pathogen virulence. To summarize the results of our study, we report that genes related to asparagine biosynthesis were overexpressed after exposing S. marcescens to LSMMG, and that the consumption rates of extracellular asparagine and glutamine in rich media were higher in LSMMG than in the control ( Figure 1 ). In nutrient-limited media, these gene expression and virulence patterns can be recapitulated by supplying only the precursors for asparagine biosynthesis: glutamine and aspartate (Figures 3 E and 4 A). The addition of aspartate causes a LSMMG-specific increase in growth of S. marcescens but not a concomitant increase in asnB gene expression ( Figure 3 D,E). Therefore, LSMMG-specific increase in expression of the asnB gene is only seen in media that contains both aspartate and glutamine, the precursors for asparagine synthesis ( Figure 3 E). Consistent with this, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine in the media during growth is also necessary for the greatest increase in host mortality in LSMMG compared to the control ( Figure 4 A). Furthermore, the coinjection of exogenous asparaginase during the infection of fly hosts with LSMMG-reared S. marcescens, results in a therapeutic effect and the flies die more slowly than with injections of the LSMMG-treated bacteria alone ( Figure 2 C). The results of this study provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the asparagine pathway in increasing S. marcescens' effectiveness to kill its host in a microgravity-specific manner. This study provides a novel mechanism by which microgravity might be affecting S. marcescens virulence via modified nutrient utilization capabilities. Importantly, we found that L-asparaginase could be used as a potential therapeutic agent during infections with bacteria in LSMMG. An interesting sequelae to this study would be to test the L-asparaginase as a countermeasure where both the host and the pathogen are exposed to microgravity during spaceflight. This study also furthers our need for understanding how LSMMG may be a unique stressor on bacterial pathogens, and emphasizes the importance of the use of ground-based models in informing spaceflight research. 3.1. Limitations of the study While this work provides evidence that LSMMG is priming the pathogen to out-compete the host immune system by the efficient utilization of amino acids such as asparagine, we have not yet evaluated the metabolomics of the host-pathogen interface after infection. That data will be collected in a subsequent study as a follow-on to this body of work where we have identified a novel mechanistic pathway that correlates Serratia marcescens virulence induced by reduced gravity environments. We were also constrained to using qPCR as the method for analyzing gene expression in this study, although RNA-seq could provide a more global assessment of gene expression changes. However, we have RNA-seq analyses ongoing for S. marcescens samples from a recent spaceflight mission. We anticipate that RNA-seq data will provide additional data to query the LSMMG-treated bacterial samples for additional genetic pathways that may be involved, since both spaceflight and LSMMG treatment results in increased growth and host mortality induced by S. marcescens . Lastly, while D. melanogaster is an excellent model for characterizing host-pathogen interactions, a future goal would be to conduct complementary studies in mammalian models in preparation for testing countermeasures like asparaginase for future spaceflight experiments. 3.2.
