    "Abstract": "Abstract The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO 2 -enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium , most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium ( C. alterfunditum , C. divergens , C. funditum , C. gallinarum , C. inhibens , C. maltaromaticum , C. mobile , C. pleistocenium , and C. viridans ) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function. Keywords: astrobiology, planetary protection",
    "Results": "Isolation of Microorganisms from Siberian Permafrost. Samples of permafrost obtained from the Siberian arctic ( Fig. 1 ) were suspended and plated on trypticase soy broth yeast extract salt (TSBYS) medium and incubated at room temperature (ca. 23 °C) for up to 28 d. Colonies were either picked or replica-plated onto fresh TSBYS plates and incubated for 30 d under low-PTA conditions. Out of a total of ∼9.3 × 10 3 colonies tested from four different permafrost soil samples, 6 colonies were observed to grow under low-PTA conditions ( Table 1 ). Five isolates, (strains WN1359 and WN1370–WN1373) were obtained from permafrost soil sample 4, and a single isolate (strain WN1374) was obtained from soil sample 9 ( Table 1 ). Fig. 1.

Growth of Permafrost Isolates Under Low-PTA Conditions. To further understand the effects of temperature, atmospheric composition, and pressure on permafrost isolates, the following experiment was performed, depicted in Fig. 2 . One hundred isolates from permafrost samples 4, 5, 8, and 9 were picked onto triplicate TSBYS plates. All plates were incubated at 0 °C for 30 d under different combinations of atmosphere and pressure. The TSBYS plate incubated at Earth atmospheric composition and pressure (i.e., low-T conditions) showed luxuriant colony development with a variety of different colony morphotypes, including distinctive orange colonies ( Fig. 2 A ). On the replicate TSBYS plate incubated under anoxic atmosphere but Earth-normal pressure of 1,013 mbar (i.e., low-TA conditions) only one colony, number 43, was able to grow ( Fig. 2 B ). This same colony was also able to grow at 7 mbar pressure under full low-PTA conditions ( Fig. 2 C ); in fact, it seemed that colony 43 actually grew best under low-PTA conditions (compare in Fig. 2 panels A , B , and C ). Isolate 43 was streak-purified and designated strain WN1359. Despite the fact that growth of the other 99 colonies was severely inhibited by 30 d of exposure to low-PTA conditions, all colonies recovered and grew rapidly (within 24 h) upon return to laboratory benchtop conditions ( Fig. 2 D ). This result is in good agreement with previous observations that growth inhibition of microbes caused by exposure to low pressure is apparently nonlethal and rapidly reversible ( 7 , 10 ). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Growth of 100 isolates from Siberian permafrost samples on TSBYS plates. Isolates are from permafrost sample 5 (colonies 1–25), 4 (colonies 26–50), 8 (colonies 51–75), and 9 (colonies 76–100). ( A–C ) All isolates were cultivated for 30 d at 0 °C under the following conditions: ( A ) Earth atmosphere and pressure. ( B ) Simulated Mars atmosphere, Earth pressure. ( C ) Simulated Mars atmosphere and pressure. Colony 43 from permafrost sample 4 was designated strain WN1359. ( D ) Same plate as in C , but after 1 additional day of incubation on the laboratory bench (i.e., at room temperature, Earth atmospheric composition and pressure). Identification of Permafrost Isolates as Carnobacterium spp. The 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences were determined for all six isolates that could grow under low-PTA conditions ( Table 1 ) and were compared with the16S rDNA database in the Ribosomal Database Project ( Fig. 3 ). All five isolates from permafrost sample 4 were found to be most closely related to Carnobacterium inhibens type strain DSM13024 T , with the following % identities: WN1359 (94.9%), WN1370 (95.7%), WN1371 (95.9%), WN1372 (96.4%), and WN1373 (96.6%). The sole isolate from permafrost sample 9, strain WN1374, was found to be most closely related to Carnobacterium viridans type strain DSM14451 T (96.7%). Using the molecular criteria that bacterial species and genera demonstrate >97% and >95% 16S rDNA sequence identity, respectively ( 11 , 12 ), the permafrost isolates likely represent unique species of the genus Carnobacterium ; however, definitive designation of species status must await more rigorous taxonomic characterization ( 13 ). It is quite interesting to note that the 16S rDNA sequences from all five Carnobacterium spp. isolates obtained from permafrost sample 4 were found to be >97% identical to Carnobacterium sp. strain LV62:W1 isolated from Lake Vanda, Antarctica (GenBank accession no. AF076637 ) ( 14 ). Furthermore, 16S rDNA from the single strain isolated from permafrost sample 9 was >97% identical to that of Carnobacterium sp. strain ARCTIC-P35 (GenBank accession no. AY573048 ( 15 ). Thus, all of the permafrost isolates obtained in this study were most closely related to other Carnobacterium spp. isolated from Arctic and Antarctic environments. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree depicting the relatedness of permafrost isolates (gray boxes) to Carnobacterium type strains. The tree was constructed using the Tree Builder program on the Ribosomal Database Project server, using Desemzia incerta as the outgroup. Numbers to the right of strain names are the GenBank accession numbers of the corresponding 16S rDNA sequences. Several of the distinctive orange colonies ( Fig. 2 ) were also characterized by 16S rDNA sequence analysis as most closely related to the Gram-positive psychrophile Exiguobacterium sibiricum strain 7-3, which was previously reported to have been isolated from permafrost samples obtained from the Kolyma region by one of the authors (D.G.) ( 16 ). Although these isolates were unable to grow under low-PTA conditions ( Fig. 2 ), this observation lent greater confidence that the Carnobacterium spp. isolates described here indeed originated from permafrost and were not contaminants. Growth Kinetics of Permafrost Isolates and Carnobacterium Type Species Under Low-PTA Conditions. At present, the genus Carnobacterium consists of ten recognized species: C. alterfunditum , C. divergens , C. funditum , C. gallinarum , C. inhibens , C. jeotgali , C. maltaromaticum , C. mobile , C. pleistocenium , and C. viridans . All Carnobacterium species to date are capable of growing at low temperatures and have been isolated from a wide variety of environments, including the Arctic and Antarctic ( Table 2 ). This observation prompted us to quantify the growth kinetics under low-PTA conditions of both the permafrost isolates and nine type species of Carnobacterium . A typical experiment performed on triplicate samples of permafrost strain WN1359 ( Fig. 4 ) showed that strain WN1359 grew better under low-TA conditions (triangles) than low-T conditions (circles), and grew best under low-PTA conditions (squares).

Data are averages and SDs of triplicate determinations. The same experiment depicted for strain WN1359 in Fig. 4 was also conducted on all six permafrost isolates ( Fig. 5 A ) and nine Carnobacterium spp. type strains ( Fig. 5 B ); to conserve space, the data were converted to number of generations each strain grew over the 28-d course of the experiment ( Materials and Methods ). All bacteria were capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, but several distinct patterns of growth under different environmental conditions emerged ( Fig. 5 ). For convenience, the growth pattern observed by strain WN1359 is designated here as abc , following its statistical grouping ( Fig. 5 A ). In other words, growth followed the pattern low-PTA > low-TA > low-T ( Fig. 5 A ). In addition to strain WN1359, strains WN1370, WN1373, C. mobile , and C. inhibens also exhibited the abc pattern of growth ( Fig. 5 ). Other growth patterns were also discernible. For example, several bacteria demonstrated an abb growth pattern (i.e., their growth followed the pattern low-TA = low-PTA > low-T). These strains included permafrost strain WN1374, C. gallinarum , C. viridans , C. divergens , C. funditum , and C. alterfunditum . Strains WN1372 and C. pleistocenium exhibited an aab growth pattern, in which they only grew better under low-PTA conditions ( Fig. 5 ). Finally, strains WN1371 and C. maltaromaticum exhibited an aaa growth pattern in which no statistical difference in growth was detected under the three conditions tested. For comparative purposes, the same experiment was performed on S. liquefaciens strain ATCC7529, also recently shown to grow at 7 mbar, which exhibited an aaa type growth pattern. Fig. 5.

Conclusions. From this work it can be seen that microbial communities from Siberian permafrost contain organisms capable of growing under conditions of low temperature, low pressure, and anoxic CO 2 -dominated atmosphere. It should be stressed, however, that low-PTA conditions are only a subset of the total potentially biotoxic physical factors constraining the survival or growth of terrestrial microbes on Mars, such as solar UV, extreme desiccation, solar particle events, and galactic cosmic rays. In addition, the martian regolith itself contains numerous potentially biotoxic factors, such as salinity, pH, and Eh of available liquid water; oxidizing soils created by UV-induced processes and soil chemical reactions; or the presence of heavy metals (discussed extensively in refs. 7 and 17 ). Not all of the tested permafrost soil samples yielded isolates, perhaps because the initial incubations were performed at room temperature ( ca . 23 °C), which would inhibit the growth of strict psychrophiles; however, all isolates obtained from this set of experiments belonged to the genus Carnobacterium . As its name suggests, the first isolates of the genus were obtained as putative spoilage organisms of meat products. In this regard it is interesting to note that three species, C. gallinarum , C. viridans , and C. divergens , were all isolated from refrigerated vacuum-packed meats ( Table 2 ), suggesting the ability of these microbes to grow under cold, low-pressure conditions. Several Carnobacterium spp. have also been isolated from permanently cold environments ( C. alterfunditum , C. funditum ), including arctic permafrost ( C. pleistocenium ) ( Table 2 ). The extreme age of the Siberian permafrost isolates reported here (∼6,000–8,000 y) and the Alaskan permafrost isolate C. pleistocenium (∼32,000 y) ( 18 ) indicates that these species are capable of long periods of survival in permanently frozen environments. Terrestrial life has evolved mechanisms to tolerate and indeed flourish in extreme high-pressure habitats such as the deep ocean ( 19 ), but very little is understood regarding microbial responses to low pressure, a physical constraint not found in nature on the Earth’s surface. The discovery of terrestrial bacteria that can inhabit cold, low-pressure, anoxic environments has implications for the fields of extremophile biology, astrobiology, the search for extraterrestrial life, and planetary protection. Permafrosts seem to be promising locations for the isolation of microbes capable of growth under cold, anoxic, and hypobaric conditions such as are encountered on Mars. It is anticipated that further sampling of permafrost from other locations or depths will yield additional microbes exhibiting this unique set of properties.",
