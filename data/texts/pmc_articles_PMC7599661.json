    "Abstract": "Abstract For decades, scientists have relied on animals to understand the risks and consequences of space travel. Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.

    "Results": "When first exposed to PWB, animals usually display a significantly lower food consumption during the first 48 h, especially when assigned to PWB20 or PWB40 groups [ 20 ]; however, cumulative food intake typically remains identical across all groups throughout the experiment [ 20 , 41 , 45 ]. Both body weight and food intake decrease can be signs of discomfort and stress, which is why daily assessment remains crucial when using the rat PWB model. Animals should be removed from the experiment when experiencing weight loss greater than 15% of their pre-suspension value [ 39 ]. Additionally, because the cages do not have as much bedding compared to a traditional rat cage and singly housing the rats prevents body heat transfer between animals, care should be taken to ensure appropriate temperature of the housing facility as alterations to core body temperature can influence overall metabolism [ 46 , 47 , 48 ], such as the use of cotton for nesting. Unloading experiments can, and have been completed by assessing several plasma parameters such as blood glucose and corticosterone, both known to increase significantly in response to stressful conditions through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [ 49 , 50 , 51 ]. As both of these parameters are regulated by the circadian rhythm, particular caution was given to the blood collection time and duration [ 52 , 53 ]. For fully-loaded animals, we showed that the full harness did not elicit a stress response during a 28 day experiment, and that reduced mechanical loading did not impact plasma glucose and corticosterone [ 45 ] at 7, 14, and 28 days of exposure compared to pre-suspension values. This finding was further validated by assessing the wet mass of several organs (i.e., adrenal glands and spleen), known to change in stressful conditions. These results represent the first evidence for the lack of chronic stress in the rat PWB model; however, future attention should be paid to the acute response in the first 48 h of exposure to decreased mechanical loading.",
    "Conclusion": "In conclusion, the PWB model is a novel experimental method that has extensive potential for the investigation of physiological alterations in response to both micro- and partial gravity. We have thus far been the first group to create and utilize the PWB in rats, both males and females, but anticipate we will not be the last. With this review we hope to encourage other biomedical investigators to adopt this model within their own laboratories. A combined research effort from many research laboratories will be imperative to thoroughly understand the complex physiology of spaceflight. More so, a broader understanding of spaceflight physiology may also facilitate important discoveries of human physiology that can benefit ground-based medicine. Regardless, to ensure the safety of astronauts in future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we need to first understand the complex interactions between human physiology and spaceflight, and the PWB model will play a critical role in unraveling these nuanced relationships.",
