    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT As part of the Microbial Tracking-2 study, 94 fungal strains were isolated from surfaces on the International Space Station, and whole-genome sequences were assembled. Characterization of these draft genomes will allow evaluation of microgravity adaption, risks to human health and spacecraft functioning, and biotechnological applications of fungi.",
