    "Results": "3.1. Females lost more bodyweight compared to males, but had similar loss in rear paw grip strength during 28-day interventions F-SHAM-0g had similar bodyweight losses compared to M-SHAM-0g ( Fig. 1 A). However, in rats post-gonadectomy, F-OVX-0g had greater bodyweight loss compared to M-CAST-0g (+14.9% v. −6.8% respectively, Fig. 1 B). After exposure to simulated partial gravity, females lost more bodyweight compared to males, in both SHAM (−9.4% v. −0.90%, Fig. 1 C) and OVX/CAST conditions (−11.4% v. −3.9%, Fig. 1 D). Fig. 1.

SHAM females and males lost similar hindlimb grip strength after 28 days exposure to 0 ​g ( Fig. 1 E). In 0g OVX/CAST animals, females had less loss in grip strength compared to males (−45.3% v. −67.9% respectively, Fig. 1 F). At 0.4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength between females and males in SHAM ( Fig. 1 G) or OVX/CAST conditions ( Fig. 1 H). 3.2. Females lost more muscle leg girth and corresponding muscle cross-sectional area compared to males In both intact and gonadectomized rats, and at both 0g and 0.4g, females had greater loss in overall leg girth compared to males (SHAM at 0g: −9.2% v. −4.87% respectfully, Fig. 2 A; OVX/CAST at 0g: −11.7% v. 0.91% Fig. 2 B; SHAM at 0.4g: 9.1% v. 0.08% respectively, Fig. 2 C; OVX/CAST at 0.4g: −10.3% v. 1.1%, Fig. 2 D).

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean. With regards to total muscle cross-sectional area loss of the lower leg, there were no differences between SHAM females and males at 0g ( Fig. 2 E). In OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0g, females tended to have greater muscle cross-sectional area loss, although not significant (−19.3% v. −9.8% respectively, Fig. 2 F). The same findings were observed in the 0.4g SHAM group (−17.9% v. −8.8%, Fig. 2 G). However, in OVX/CAST rats exposed to 0.4g, females had significantly greater muscle cross-sectional area loss compared to males (−16.8% v. −3.8% respectively, Fig. 2 H). 3.3. Females had similar losses in muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as males at 0g but greater muscle fiber area loss than males at 0.4g In both SHAM and OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0 ​g, there were no differences between females and males in relative difference in muscle fiber area ( Fig. 3 A–B). However, at 0.4 ​g in SHAM and OVX/CAST animals, females had greater loss in total muscle fiber area than males (−34.8% v. −15.1% respectively, Fig. 3 C). Moreover, this relationship was sustained in OVX/CAST animals (−29.8% v. −15.0% respectively, Fig. 3 D). Fig. 3.

Individual data points are percent difference from within sex and hormone-status 1g (fully loaded) control animals. Data are presented as Mean ​± ​ SEM . SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean. In myosin heavy chain type I-positive fibers (hereafter referred to as type I fibers), there was no difference between SHAM females and males after 0g intervention ( Fig. 3 E), nor within OVX/CAST rats ( Fig. 3 F). After 0.4g interventions, both SHAM and OVX females had greater type I fiber area loss compared to males (−34.7% v. −12.4% respectively, Fig. 3 G and −28.3% v. −13.9% respectively, Fig. 3 H). At 0g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats there were no relative differences in the changes in myosin heavy chain type II positive (Type II) fibers between females and males ( Fig. 3 I–J). At 0.4g, SHAM females were not different than males in the relative loss of Type II fibers ( Fig. 3 K), while OVX females tended to have greater relative differences in type II fiber area, though this did not reach significance (−35.3% v. −17.1%, Fig. 3 L). In muscle fibers expressing both type I and type II isoforms (hybrid fibers), there was no difference between sham females and males at 0 ​g ( Fig. 3 M). However, in 0g CAST/OVX animals, females had a greater loss in hybrid fibers compared to males (−46.7% v. −29.1% respectively, Fig. 3 N). After exposure to 0.4g, in both SHAM and OVX/CAST rats, females had greater fiber area loss compared to males (−34.9% v. −13.6% respectively, Fig. 3 O and −35.9% v. −13.2% respectively, Fig. 3 P). 3.4. Females had greater reductions in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion parameters compared to males at both 0g and 0.4g At 0g, SHAM females lost more dorsiflexion power (peak force divided by time to reach peak force) compared to males (−45.2% v. +27.8% respectively, Fig. 4 A), while no differences were detected in OVX/CAST groups at 0g ( Fig. 4 B). At 0.4g, there was no difference between SHAM females and males in dorsiflexion power loss ( Fig. 4 C). Within OVX/CAST animals exposed to 0.4g, females tended to have greater loss in dorsiflexion power, though this difference did not reach significance (−36.1% v. +7.8% respectively, Fig. 4 D). We should note that, although the males showed a slight increase in dorsiflexion parameters, the 1g controls animal had greater increases over time. 18 Fig. 4.

SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean. Maximal plantar flexion power was also evaluated. At 0g, females lost more plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−31.1% v. −3.2% respectively, Fig. 4 E and −15.9% v. 12.3% respectively, ( Fig. 4 F). Additionally, at 0.4g, females also had greater loss in plantar flexion power compared to males under both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions (−6.5% v. 16.2%, Fig. 4 G and −10.7% v. 10.0%, Fig. 4 H). 3.5. Females tended to have greater loss in hindlimb muscle mass compared to males In SHAM 0g rats, females tended to have attenuated differences in gastrocnemius mass compared to males, though this difference was not significant (−26.4% v. −32.7%, Fig. 5 A). Contrastingly, in OVX/CAST 0g rats, females tended to have greater loss in gastrocnemius mass relative to males; however, this difference was again not significant (−32.0% v. −25.3%, Fig. 5 B). At 0.4g, females in both SHAM and OVX conditions tended to have greater decreases in gastrocnemius mass compared to males; however, neither of these differences reached significance (−21.1% v. −16.2%, Fig. 5 C and −24.3% v. −18.4%, Fig. 5 D).

Data are presented as Mean ​± ​ SEM . SHAM ​= ​sham surgery animals with intact gonads, CAST ​= ​castrated males, OVX ​= ​ovariectomized females, SEM ​= ​standard error of the mean. There were no differences between females and males in relative soleus alterations at 0g in either SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions (−53.6% v. −50.1%, Fig. 5 E and −53.5% v. −52.9%, Fig. 5 F). However, at 0.4g in both SHAM and OVX/CAST conditions, females had greater decreases in soleus mass compared to males (−34.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5 G and −32.8% v. −22.8%, Fig. 5 H). Within the tibialis anterior (TA), there were no differences between females and males (SHAM or OVX/CAST) at 0g (−14.0% v. −20.4%, Fig. 5 I and −18.7% v. −18.6%, Fig. 5 J). Similarly, at 0.4g ​there were no differences between females and males in TA mass change, regardless of hormonal status (SHAM, −21.3% v. −18.0%, Fig. 5 K and OVX/CAST, −26.7% v. −23.7%, Fig. 5 L). At 0g, SHAM females had attenuated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) loss compared to males (−8.1% v. −15.7%, Fig. 5 M). However, this difference was not observed in OXV/CAST rats ( Fig. 5 N). After exposure to 0.4g, there were no differences in EDL changes between the sexes, regardless of SHAM or OVX/CAST conditions ( Fig. 5 O-P).",
    "Conclusion": "There remains scientific controversy on how biological sex may influence the trajectory of diseases. Our study builds on prior research in this domain 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. These differences are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal losses upon exposure to different gravitational environments. Moreover, these sex differences were present regardless of the presence or absence of sex steroid hormones; this strongly implies that sex differences in musculoskeletal pathologies are more complex than simple differences in the sex steroid hormone milieu. Our data demonstrate that females experience greater relative loss across various components of muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments, including muscle size ( Figs. 2 , Fig 3 , and Fig 5 ) and muscle strength ( Fig. 4 ), compared to males. These data agree with prior studies in mice undergoing short-term exposure to disuse atrophy, 9 , 10 but conflict with recent works in rats undergoing 14 days of disuse. 8 Although sparse, human data on disuse also appear to suggest that females have slightly worse musculoskeletal outcomes with disuse compared to males. For example, in a recent study of immobilization in humans, females had lower force relative to muscle volume after arm immobilization whereas males did not have these changes. 19 Although males tended to have greater loss in muscle area, females appeared to have greater alterations to intrinsic muscle force. 19 Additionally, in patients within the intensive care units, females have greater reductions in handgrip strength compared to males. 20 Other studies in humans have found comparable rectus femoris area loss between males and females after undergoing immobilization for a femoral fracture. 21 In aggregate, our data appear to generally be consistent with prior studies investigating the influence of biological sex and musculoskeletal outcomes during disuse, with females tending to have exacerbated musculoskeletal loss during exposure to unloading compared to males. It is noteworthy that we found OVX/CAST had little effect on overall differences between males and females. If sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. Yet, we find that sex differences remain and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. Our previous studies using these same rats demonstrated that a lack of testosterone during unloading had little effect on muscle losses during exposure to either 0g or 0.4g. 15 In contrast, although subtle, ovariectomy appeared to exacerbate musculoskeletal losses in females. 15 Taken together with the current analysis, it is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences between males and females. The relationship between changes in estrous cycle and subsequent muscle size is supported by multiple prior studies across multiple conditions associated with muscle loss. 22 , 23 , 24 Regardless, our finding that presence of gonadal derived hormones does not solely mediate sex-based differences in the trajectory of musculoskeletal loss suggests that other factors in addition to gonadal hormones contribute to the observed sex differences. It is possible differences in chromosomal make-up between females and males (i.e. XX vs XY), and subsequent gene expression may be underlying these differences unloading-induced muscle atrophy. However, that specific research question is beyond the scope of the current investigation. Additionally, we must acknowledge that due to the design of the study we cannot specific precisely which hormones may be contributing directly or indirectly to these findings. We must acknowledge that our results are in opposition of a prior report by our group using the same hindlimb unloading technique in rats to investigate the influence of biological sex and muscle loss during disuse. 8 It is not entirely clear what may account for the discrepancies between these studies. It is possible that the duration of unloading between our current investigation and the prior study (28 v. 14 days of simulated 0g) could account for such differences; however, this explanation seems unlikely as prior studies using shorter durations (1–7 days) of disuse have found female mice tend to have worse skeletal muscle outcomes relative to males. 9 , 10 It is worth noting prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males such as greater induction of atrophy-related genes 10 as well as greater relative induction of reactive oxygen species compared to males. 9 We speculate that strain differences (Wistar v. Fischer) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. First, Wistar rats are outbred strains of rats compared to Fischer rats, which are inbred. Theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic variability and hence less variability. However, recent works have demonstrated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than would be expected in inbred rat strains. 25 There has been extensive debate on the scientific validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred strains, 26 , 27 which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation. Regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is difficult to directly speculate based on the current data. However, given there is human data to complement the current study, 19 , 20 it is at minimum physiologically plausible the Fischer rat is an appropriate recapitulation of human physiology for the current investigation. Differences between males and females can be inherently difficult to analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females; therefore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex differences. Moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall trajectory of muscle loss. It would not be feasible to match males and females on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age or females being larger than average for their age. Therefore, for this study we opted to utilize a relative change score (percent change) and account for baseline differences with a covariate. We believe this analysis strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the influence of sex on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro- and partial gravity environments. To facilitate this method of analysis for future researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in supplementary files. 18 It is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between males and females were present to a greater extent at 0.4g compared to 0g. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. At 0g, it is possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential sex differences. In contrast, exposure to 0.4g, which is a comparatively milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences between males and females undergoing disuse. We assert that this partial weight-bearing model may be an ideal model to study the subtle nuances between males and females and susceptibility to disuse atrophy. Specific to NASA, with the forthcoming Artemis missions and goal of building a base on the Moon, sex differences are extremely relevant. Terrestrially, rarely do muscle immobilizations involve a complete unloading of the tissue; therefore, partial weight-bearing may be a more relevant model for investigating musculoskeletal responses to disuse and how biological sex may interact with these responses. Applying our rodent model to humans, our data imply female astronauts are likely to experience greater relative musculoskeletal loss and likely prolonged recovery compared to male counterparts upon exposure to micro- and partial-gravity environments. One well-known countermeasure to mitigate micro-gravity induced musculoskeletal deterioration is exercise, which is currently part of the standard of care for astronauts on the ISS. Recent meta-analysis suggests comparable exercise adaptations to males and females with resistance exercise. 28 These findings in combination with our results may suggest females require slightly more resistance exercise to mitigate the effects of micro- or partial-gravity environments. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tests and warrants further study. Additionally, while this study did not specifically evaluate muscle recovery after exposure to reduced mechanical loading, it is expected, given the greater reduction in muscle size and strength, that females would have a more prolonged recovery relative to males. Estradiol is known to be an important regulator of regenerative capacity in females. 29 , 30 The interaction between a low estrogen state during micro- or partial-gravity and inherently greater muscle loss in female astronauts may create a “double hit” effect on skeletal muscle, whereby muscle regeneration and recovery are prolonged. Practically, this could result in increased occupational risk for female astronauts after long-duration space flights; therefore, additional interventions may be necessary to either mitigate muscle loss in female astronauts or facilitate recovery upon return to Earth. Terrestrially, conditions that result in muscle disuse and estradiol alterations may be particularly exacerbated in females and may require longer recovery periods. We must acknowledge a few limitations to the current investigation. Gonadectomy removes many other hormones other than simply androgens and estrogens. Therefore, it is possible lack of other hormones produced be sex organs many have influenced our results in possibly unpredictable ways. Additionally, our study used fairly young (14 weeks of age) rats, corresponding approximately to young adult age. Considering the average age for astronauts is approximately 45 years of age, 31 it is possible using younger animals may not fully recapitulate a slightly older human population. Finally, we were only able to model mechanical unloading associated with spaceflight. Space travel is associated with multiple environmental stressors such as space radiation, sleep disturbances and others. Therefore, it is conceivable these other variables may interact with micro- or partial-gravity to alter our conclusions regarding the influence of biological sex and muscle loss. Regardless, we believe our current data provides valuable information on the ramifications of micro- and partial-gravity environments to musculoskeletal function in males and females. In conclusion, we have demonstrated female rats have greater loss in muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long-duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. However, given the discrepancy of the current investigation compared to prior works, 8 more research is likely needed to fully evaluate the influence of biological sex on disuse-induced muscle loss. If these results prove analogous for humans, it is likely that females are at increased risk for adverse muscle and related functional outcomes after exposure to reduced gravitation. Given the potential future of spaceflight, both scientific and commercial, more research is necessary to better understand risks and potential preventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recovery. Importantly, since, based on this rat data, females have accelerated muscle loss during exposure to micro- or partial-gravity environments, interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex-specific in order to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes.",
