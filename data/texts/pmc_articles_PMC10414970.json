    "Abstract": "Abstract Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H + -ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H + -ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip. Research organism: A. thaliana",
    "Results": "The Arabidopsis root shows distinct acidic and alkaline root surface pH domains To monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of root ion fluxes and apoplastic pH in vertically growing roots of A. thaliana , we re-evaluated the available fluorescence staining methods to visualize pH in roots. Cell wall staining by 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) ( Barbez et al., 2017 ) was not satisfactory in our setup, due to the very high background signal and probably due to the absence of the optimal 458 nm excitation in our vertical stage spinning disk microscope ( Serre et al., 2021 ). However, at the transition zone of the root, we could observe an alkaline domain on the root surface ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1a ). Further, we attempted to visualize root surface pH using Fluorescein Dextran and Oregon Green Dextran ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1a ) pH reporters ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ; Geilfus and Mühling, 2011 ), but the results were not satisfactory due to an artifact when roots were imaged on solid medium ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1d ). We therefore searched for alternative pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes, and discovered Fluorescein-5-(and-6)-Sulfonic Acid, Trisodium Salt (FS) (Invitrogen F1130; Seksek et al., 1995 ; Rosario and Rojas, 1986 ) as an excellent reporter of root surface pH. The F 488/405 excitation ratio of FS efficiently reported pH when dissolved in liquid or solid medium ( Figure 1a–d , Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,c ). The F 488/405 excitation ratio of FS is insensitive to the redox state of the medium but influenced by cation concentration ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1e ). FS allows to visualize pH of the root surface and the surrounding rhizosphere, without penetrating the root tissues ( Figure 1e ). The pH imaging with FS highlighted the previously described relatively alkaline domain in the transition zone/early elongation zone of the root ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ; Staal et al., 2011 ). In addition, we observed two relatively acidic pH domains, one located in the late elongation/root hair zone and the other in the proximity of the root tip ( Figure 1e ). To unbiasedly quantify the root surface pH, we developed a Python-based program to determine the F 488/405 ratio of the root surface ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1f ). The quantification highlighted the presence of the observed relatively alkaline and acidic domains ( Figure 1f ). Throughout the text, we will refer to these domains as alkaline and acidic domains, by which we mean values relatively acidic or relatively alkaline in comparison with the pH of the medium. The surface pH profile of roots shown by FS is in agreement with the data obtained using numerous electrode and microscopy measurements in several species including A. thaliana ( Zieschang et al., 1993 ; Staal et al., 2011 ; Monshausen et al., 1996 ; Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997 ). The FS pH detection range thus reveals both the alkaline and acidic domains of the root surface and allows direct and dynamic visualization of proton concentration on the root surface and its close surroundings.

The root surface is automatically recognized, creating a defined region of interest (ROI) in a 10-pixel distance from the surface. Fluorescence intensities in 488 and 405 nm excitation channels are measured in the ROIs. The data is binned and the FS F 488/405 excitation ratio is calculated as a function of distance from the root tip. Scale bar = 100 µm.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig1-figsupp1-data1.xlsx (133.4KB, xlsx) Open in a new tab The alkaline domain in the transition zone is not directly determined by AHA activation or localization We first hypothesized that the observed spatial surface pH gradients might originate from gradients of AHA ATPase abundance or activity ( Großeholz et al., 2022 ). We therefore immunolocalized endogenous AHAs using the antibody which recognizes multiple AHA ATPases paralogs in multiple plant species (Agrisera AS07260). To test the specificity of the antibody in Arabidopsis roots, we imaged Col-0 roots, aha2-4 mutants lacking the dominant AHA2 paralogue, and lines inducibly expressing a dominant version of AHA2 (AHA2-d95-mScarlet). The antibody showed signal in the PM in Col-0 and aha2-4 roots ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b ). When we inducibly overexpressed the AHA2-d95-mScarlet, we detected colocalization of the mScarlet signal with the antibody signal ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1c ). These results indicate that the antibody recognized multiple plasma membrane localized AHAs in Arabidopsis roots. The immunolocalization of endogenous AHAs, however, didn’t reveal any obvious absence of AHAs in the transition zone ( Figure 2a , Figure 2—figure supplement 1d ) that would explain the presence of the alkaline domain. To overcome the hypothetical lack of AHA activation in the TZ, we treated seedlings with fusicoccin (FC), a fungal toxin that stimulates the AHA’s activity ( Ballio et al., 1964 ) and thus increases proton efflux. FC lowered the surface pH of the root acidic domains but, surprisingly, did not affect the alkaline domain ( Figure 2b and c ). This partial acidification was correlated with the known FC-induced stimulation of root growth ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2a ). Figure 2.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig2-figsupp2-data1.xlsx (318.1KB, xlsx) Open in a new tab To exclude an FC-independent regulation of AHAs in the TZ, we created A. thaliana lines inducibly expressing a fluorescently tagged hyperactive version of AHA2 ( Pacheco-Villalobos et al., 2016 ) - AHA2-d95-mScarlet, and lines expressing an inhibitor of AHAs PP2CD1-mScarlet ( Ren et al., 2018 ) under the control of the epidermal/cortex PIN2 promoter ( Figure 2d ). Expression of hyperactive AHA2 increased the acidic domain in the root tip, slightly reduced the alkaline domain, but did not prevent its formation ( Figure 2e and f ). This restricted acidification led to a tendency to stimulate root growth ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2b ). Inhibition of AHA activity by overexpression of PP2C-D1 raised the overall root tip surface pH, but did not prevent the formation of the alkaline domain in the TZ ( Figure 2e and f ). Alkalinization of the root tip surface correlated with a statistically insignificant reduction of root growth ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2b ). We further measured the root surface pH profile of aha2 and pp2c-d triple mutants that showed decreased ( Haruta and Sussman, 2012 ) and increased ( Ren et al., 2018 ) AHA activity, respectively. Plants lacking the expression of PP2CDs showed a significantly acidified root tip surface, however, the alkaline halo remained unaffected ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h ). On the other hand, plants lacking the expression of AHA2 were slightly impaired in the alkaline halo domain formation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2f and h ). aha2-4 roots were growing slower than Col-0 while pp2c-d triple root growth was stimulated ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2g ). The manipulation of the AHA proton pump activity resulted in the expected outcome of influencing the overall root surface pH and root growth. However, the spatial organization of the root surface pH profile with the alkaline domain of the TZ does not appear to be simply controlled by the activation or abundance of AHAs, as the alkaline domain cannot be fully removed by genetic or pharmacological modulation of the proton pumping activity. The establishment of the alkaline pH domain requires AUX1 It is well established that the application of auxin to roots causes an increase in apoplastic and root surface pH ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ; Shih et al., 2015 ; Li et al., 2021 ). To investigate the effect of auxin application on surface pH profile and formation of the TZ alkaline domain, we analyzed surface pH in response to the native auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). With the increasing IAA concentration, the alkaline domain pH rose and the domain expanded toward the elongation zone of the root, which resulted in disappearance of the acidic domain ( Figure 3a and b ). The extent of the surface alkalinization correlated with IAA-induced root growth inhibition; the response was detectable at 1 nM IAA and was saturated between 100 and 1000 nM IAA ( Figure 3c ). This implies that the entire root surface is capable of alkalinization upon external auxin treatment, and that the alkaline domain is the hotspot of auxin response. Figure 3. Auxin influx by AUX1 is essential for the initiation of the alkaline domain. ( a–c ) Surface pH correlates with growth rate-dose response of Col-0 roots to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) auxin.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig3-figsupp1-data1.xlsx (158.6KB, xlsx) Open in a new tab We further analyzed the root surface pH response to IAA in line with altered AHA activity. The PIN2>>AHA2-d95 and PIN2>>PP2 CD1 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2c and d ) as well as the pp2c-d triple mutant responded to IAA treatment by alkalinization of the root surface pH ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2h and i ). The alkalinization factors (a measure of IAA-induced alkalinization) were similar to Col-0 with the exception of the very root tip of pp2c-d triple which responded slightly less ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2e and j ). These results were correlated with control level IAA-induced root growth inhibition ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and g ). On the other hand, knockout mutation of AHA2 led to reduced IAA-induced root surface alkalinization ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2h, i and j ), but strong enough to observe an auxin-induced root growth inhibition ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2g ). The alkaline domain does not seem to be caused by the lack of proton efflux in the TZ, and the amplitude of the alkaline domain can be increased by auxin application. We therefore tested how auxin transport, perception, and response contribute to the spatial determination of root surface pH. First, we tested the mutant in the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier, in which the shootward auxin flux through the outer root tissues is perturbed ( Luschnig et al., 1998 ; Müller et al., 1998 ). The pin2 mutant root showed a reduced alkaline domain that was shifted toward the root tip ( Figure 3d and e ). Upon application of 10 nM IAA to pin2 mutant, the alkaline domain position and amplitude were partially restored ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b ), the pin2 roots also responded to auxin by growth inhibition ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1c ). Upon treatment with 100 nM IAA, the alkaline domain and the overall IAA-induced root alkalinization were fully restored ( Figure 3d and f and Figure 3—figure supplement 1d and e ). The auxin influx carrier AUX1 is essential for auxin uptake and transport during root gravitropism ( Swarup et al., 2005 ; Band et al., 2014 ), and the null aux1 mutant was shown to have a more acidic surface with an altered root tip pH profile ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ). We determined the root surface pH profile in the aux1 mutant, and found that its pH showed a gradual decrease from the tip toward the root hair zone. While the acidic zone in the elongation zone was comparable to control roots, aux1 mutants displayed a complete absence of the TZ alkaline domain ( Figure 3d and e ). Application of 10 nM IAA on aux1 mutants did not affect root elongation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1c ) and did not trigger a root surface alkalinization in contrast to the control Col-0 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b ). However, at 100 nM IAA, when IAA diffusion compensates for AUX1 function ( Evans et al., 1994 ), aux1 mutant showed a clear IAA-induced root growth inhibition ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1e ) as well as an increased root surface pH beyond the TZ ( Figure 3d and f and Figure 3—figure supplement 1d ). The wild-type (WT)-like root surface pH profile was, however, not restored by IAA application, demonstrating that AUX1 is essential for creating the alkaline surface domain in the transition zone. As the immunolocalization pattern of AHAs in the aux1 mutant was comparable to the Col-0 control ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1d ), we treated the mutant with FC to investigate the activation status of AHAs in the aux1 mutant. Interestingly, this treatment resulted in the establishment of a small alkaline domain also in the aux1 mutant ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1f and h ), likely caused by AHA-mediated acidification in the root tip and the distal elongation zone that did not affect the TZ surface pH. The partial acidification was again correlated with a significant root growth stimulation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1g ). This experiment showed that AHAs are not fully activated in aux1 mutant and implies a specific surface pH response of the cells of the TZ. In summary, we have shown that the distinctive alkaline domain at the transition zone of the root depends on AUX1-mediated auxin influx. Without auxin influx, the root shows a linear acidification gradient from the root tip to the maturation zone. The components of the rapid auxin response pathway steer the transition zone root surface pH Once in the cytoplasm, auxin triggers responses either through the canonical auxin signaling pathway or the auxin rapid response pathway ( Dubey et al., 2021 ). We examined the involvement of these pathways in the establishment of the surface pH profile of the root. First, we investigated the components of the canonical auxin signaling by using the tir1,afb2,3 (tir triple ) mutant which lacks the expression of three of the six known auxin receptors ( Dharmasiri et al., 2005 ). The tir triple mutant displayed a more acidic surface pH, particularly in the elongation and maturation zone ( Figure 4a and b ). However, it was still displaying an alkaline domain, albeit less pronounced than the control. In response to IAA, tir triple was critically impaired in whole root IAA-induced surface pH alkalinization ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1b and c ). As a result, tir triple was also impaired in the IAA-induced root growth inhibition ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1a ). These results confirm that the canonical auxin signaling is involved in the auxin-induced apoplastic alkalinization ( Li et al., 2021 ) and also partially in the longitudinal surface pH zonation. Next, to test the role of the TMK1-ABP1 apoplastic auxin perception pathway ( Li et al., 2021 ; Friml et al., 2022 ) in the establishment of root surface pH profile, we analyzed the root surface pH profiles of tmk1 , tmk4 , and abp1 mutants. The surface pH profile of the mutants was, however, comparable to the Col-0 controls ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1d, e and f ). Figure 4. Rapid auxin signaling steers root surface pH.

Data used for generating the graphs in the figure. elife-85193-fig4-figsupp2-data1.xlsx (278.9KB, xlsx) Open in a new tab We further explored the role of the recently discovered molecular actors of the auxin rapid response - AFB1 and CNGC14. AFB1 is the paralogue of the TIR1 receptor; AFB1 has been shown to be crucial for the rapid growth inhibition upon auxin treatment, rapid auxin-induced membrane depolarization, and for the early response to gravistimulation ( Prigge et al., 2020 ; Serre et al., 2021 ). Similarly, the mutant in the calcium channel CNGC14 lacks the auxin-induced calcium transient, membrane depolarization, and shows a delay in the early gravitropic response ( Shih et al., 2015 ; Dindas et al., 2018 ). We analyzed the root surface pH of both mutants and found a more acidic root surface with a critically flat alkaline domain in the afb1 mutant ( Figure 4c and d and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a ) as well as in the cngc14 mutant ( Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b ). We confirmed the similar result in additional alleles of afb1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2c ) and cngc14 mutants ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2d ). This shows that these proteins, apart from controlling the rapid auxin response, steer the pH profile of the root during normal steady-state growth by controlling the alkaline domain in the transition zone. The lack of the alkaline domain was not caused by mislocalization or absence of AUX1 protein in the afb1 or cngc14 mutants ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2e ). Similarly to the aux1 mutant, the localization of AHA H + ATPases in both mutants was not obviously different from the Col-0 control ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1d ). We further tested how the afb1 and cngc14 mutants respond to IAA and found an overall alkalinization of the root surface with a partial rescue of the alkaline domain ( Figure 4d and f ) and partially impaired growth inhibition ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2f–h ). What makes the TZ zone surface pH different from the other domains of the roots? A plausible explanation is the localization of relevant molecular components in this region of the root. The auxin transporters AUX1 and PIN2 have been shown to localize to the lateral root cap and epidermis ( Müller et al., 1998 ; Swarup et al., 2004 , Figure 4g ). Prigge et al., 2020 , showed that AFB1 is expressed in the root tip and we could see an enrichment of the protein in the root epidermis ( Figure 4g ). To determine the localization of CNGC14, we expressed its fluorescently C-terminally tagged version under the control of its native promoter. The expression of CNGC14 fusion protein was rather weak, and localized to the PM of root epidermal cells, with an enrichment in the transition zone ( Figure 4g and h ). The expression of AFB1-mCitrine and CNGC14-GFP in the respective mutants recovered the presence of the TZ alkaline domain ( Figure 4c, d, e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a, b and d ). Interestingly, the expression of CNGC14-GFP in cngc14 caused an exaggerated TZ alkaline domain ( Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b and d ), which underlines the importance of the CNGC14 calcium channel in the establishment of root surface pH profile. These results show that the signaling components so far associated with the rapid auxin response are expressed in the root epidermis and contribute to the longitudinal zonation of root surface pH profile. The alkaline domain of the TZ represents a site of a constant rapid auxin response that is triggered by the internal auxin fluxes mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 transporters. On the other hand, the overall increase of root surface pH upon auxin treatment can be attributed to the TIR1 canonical signaling pathway. The AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module facilitates root navigation It was shown that auxin induces alkalinization of the apoplastic pH and that this alkalinization correlates and is required for the inhibition of root growth. The same process occurs during the gravitropic response - the lower root side responds to the internal auxin by alkalinization, resulting in root bending ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ; Shih et al., 2015 ; Barbez et al., 2017 ). We reanalyzed the root surface pH using our pH imaging and quantifications, as it enables us to monitor alkalinization, as well as acidification of the root surface. Upon gravistimulation, the TZ alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified ( Figure 5a , Video 1 ). This led to a gradient of surface pH across the root that was established within 5 min of the gravistimulation which correlated with initiation of bending of the root ( Figure 5a ). The disappearance of the alkaline halo on the upper root surface indicates that the TZ domain might act as a zone of stalled growth which is rapidly activated upon gravistimulation. We further analyzed the gravitropic responses of the mutants with altered root surface pH zonation. As expected, the agravitropic aux1 mutant did not create a pH gradient across the root and did not bend ( Figure 5b ). Manipulation of the AHA activity by the application of FC or by genetic means did not prevent the formation of a gradient of surface pH and rapid bending of the root ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1a and b ). Finally, the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a slower gravitropic response, as reported before ( Serre et al., 2021 ; Shih et al., 2015 ; Figure 5c and d ). As both mutants have a diminished alkaline domain in the TZ, upon gravistimulation, this zone could not rapidly react to change in auxin fluxes; instead, a shallow gradient of surface pH slowly develops in the mutants ( Figure 5c and d ).

In the aux1 , afb1 , and cngc14 mutants, the alkaline domain was absent or less prominent during vertical growth ( Video 3 ). This result and the fact that the components of the rapid auxin response pathway are involved in the formation of the alkaline domain indicates that, in this zone, the cells continuously rapidly respond to the internal auxin fluxes, and that this pathway is active not only upon gravistimulation. We hypothesized that the significance of this process is to constantly correct the growth rate fluctuations and to enable the root to quickly regulate the growth direction of the root tip. This would be particularly relevant in the soil environment, where the root tip penetrates the soil particles and constantly corrects growth direction using the gravity vector. To test this hypothesis, we tested the ability of WT and aux1 , afb1, and cngc14 mutants to navigate through artificial obstacles, approximated by tilted agar plates covered with a rectangular nylon grid. We scored the efficiency of the roots in penetrating the grids with varying pore sizes ( Figure 5f ). WT plants penetrated the meshes more efficiently as the pore size increased, whereas the agravitropic aux1 mutant failed to penetrate in all conditions. Interestingly, both the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a significant decrease in penetration efficiency compared to the WT ( Figure 5g ). Video 2.

In summary, the alkaline surface pH domain originates from a constant rapid auxin response driven by the AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module. This response enables the roots to rapidly react to gravity vector changes and to adjust the root tip growth direction.",
    "Conclusion": "In this work, we present a new method to determine the root surface pH of A. thaliana . Its advantage is the sensitivity of FS in lower pH range that enables a spectacular visualization of root surface pH, including the acidic domain surrounding the late elongation and maturation zones of roots, which was not detected with the previously published methods ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ; Shih et al., 2015 ). FS is an inexpensive dye which can be excited by the common 405 and 488 nm laser lines. In this work, we avoided measuring absolute pH values; instead, we determined the relative pH compared to internal controls observed on the same medium. Absolute pH determination would be possible, if extensive pH calibration was performed during each imaging session. This approach would be very laborious, and, in addition, absolute fluorescence intensities might depend on the thickness of the layer of medium and many other parameters. Therefore, we recommend using FS to determine relative pH changes compared to internal controls, that is WT plants or mock controls imaged together with mutants or treated roots. We showed that apart from pH, FS can also react to other ions, however, given that the surface pH profile visualized by FS staining is in full accordance with the previously published works ( Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997 ; Weisenseel et al., 1979 ; Björkman and Leopold, 1987 ; Behrens et al., 1982 ; Iwabuchi et al., 1989 ; Staal et al., 2011 ), we conclude that in the growth media, FS reflects primarily the root surface pH. According to the acid growth theory, acidic pH enables cell wall extension ( Rayle and Cleland, 1992 ; Hager, 2003 ). We observed the lowest pH values in the very tip of the root and in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. On the other hand, the alkaline domain partially covers the early elongation zone. The surface pH therefore does not fully correlate with the local growth rates ( Beemster and Baskin, 1998 ; Shih et al., 2015 ). In addition, it remains to be resolved to what extent the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH ( Barbez et al., 2017 ; Moreau et al., 2022 ). It is possible that rather than driving cell elongation, the acidic domain in the maturation zone plays a role in nutrient acquisition and absorption by the root hairs ( Martín-Barranco et al., 2021 ). The cytokinin-mediated cell wall stiffening may become the dominant growth-regulating mechanism in this root zone, leading to growth cessation despite low extracellular pH ( Liu et al., 2022 ). Based on genetic and pharmacological experiments we concluded that the longitudinal surface pH zonation is not based solely on the activity and abundance of PM AHA H + ATPases, but instead, the alkaline domain in the transition zone is driven by AUX1-mediated auxin influx and AFB1 signaling. The surface pH might be determined solely by AHA activity in the specific case of the aux1 mutant, where the pH progressively decreases in the shootward direction, and might then reflect the AHA activity gradient that is determined by the abundance of the proton pumps and their regulation by brassinosteroid signaling, as suggested by Großeholz et al., 2022 . Interestingly, even in the aux1 mutant, a residual AHA-independent alkaline domain is present and can be visualized when AHAs are hyperactivated by the application of FC. In agreement with these results, the ectopic AHA ATPases activation also cannot prevent the auxin-induced growth inhibition and the gravitropic bending of roots. Inhibition of AHA activity led to slower growth, a tendency of slower gravitropic response, and the aha2-4 mutation caused a reduced auxin-induced surface alkalinization. In addition to controlling membrane potential and apoplastic pH, AHA activity influences auxin signaling by regulating auxin influx and diffusion into cells ( Rubery and Sheldrake, 1973 ; Yang et al., 2006 ). These results might thus be caused by the reduced proton motive force that in turn might interfere with IAA uptake into the cells. What is the cause of the alkaline domain at the transition zone, if not the inhibition of AHA ATPase activity? It was shown that the auxin-induced apoplast and root surface alkalinization is accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic pH ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ; Li et al., 2021 ), indicating that the alkaline domain visualized by the FS is caused by a proton influx into cells. The phenotype of the aux1 mutant hints to the possibility that the AUX1-mediated auxin symport with protons ( Lomax et al., 1985 ) might cause the observed root surface alkalinization. Also supporting this hypothesis, the transition zone of maize roots is the site of the highest auxin influx, as measured by an auxin-specific electrode ( Mancuso et al., 2005 ). On the other hand, the aux1 mutant was capable of surface alkalinization when higher concentrations of IAA were added, demonstrating that the AUX1-mediated influx per se is not required for surface alkalinization. Further, the afb1 mutants show a defect in the alkaline domain formation, which favors the explanation that the auxin-induced alkalinization is triggered from the AFB1 receptor. Given that the mutant in CNGC14 is defective in establishing root surface pH profile, auxin-induced alkalinization and auxin-induced calcium influx ( Shih et al., 2015 ), and calcium influx and pH changes are tightly coupled ( Behera et al., 2018 ), we conclude that CNGC14 functions downstream of AFB1. Similarly, Li et al., 2021 , suggested that auxin-induced alkalinization of the apoplast is mediated by a yet unknown mechanism. It is intriguing to speculate that the signaling pathway might operate via the adenylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors ( Qi et al., 2022 ). We show that the rapid auxin response pathway, so far connected with the reaction to auxin application ( Fendrych et al., 2018 ; Li et al., 2021 ; Monshausen et al., 2011 ) or the gravitropic response ( Serre et al., 2021 ; Shih et al., 2015 ), operates constantly in the growing A. thaliana root. Even though the other TIR1/AFB co-receptors partially contribute to the longitudinal surface pH zonation, AFB1 plays the most important role. The other TIR1/AFB receptors seem to be more important for the overall pH rise upon the application of IAA, in agreement with the results of Li et al., 2021 . The localization of the alkaline zone seems to be determined by the intersection of the PIN2-mediated shootward auxin flux ( Luschnig et al., 1998 ; Müller et al., 1998 ), localization of the AUX1-mediated auxin influx ( Swarup et al., 2005 ; Band et al., 2014 ), and the enrichment of the AFB1 and CNGC14 proteins. We propose that the dynamic nature of the surface alkalinization observed by us and others ( Monshausen et al., 2011 ; Shih et al., 2015 ) results from the interaction of the intensity of the auxin flux and the constant rapid response that occurs in the alkaline domain of the root tip. In addition, the auxin-induced alkalinization is constantly being counterbalanced by the TMK-mediated AHA ATPase activation and apoplast acidification ( Li et al., 2021 ; Friml et al., 2022 ; Lin et al., 2021 ). Upon gravistimulation, the alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified, which is consistent with previous pH measurements done by electrodes ( Zieschang et al., 1993 ; Monshausen et al., 1996 ), indicating that the alkaline domain corresponds to a zone of a stalled cell elongation that can be rapidly regulated upon gravistimulation. In addition to the gene expression changes that occur during obstacle avoidance ( Jacobsen et al., 2021 ) and the FERONIA-mediated mechanoperception ( Shih et al., 2014 ), the rapid auxin response module in the root decreases the reaction time of the root to the changes of root growth direction, and thus increases the efficiency of root soil penetration.",
