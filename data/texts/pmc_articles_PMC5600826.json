    "Abstract": "Abstract DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation ( Bdnf IV ) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes. Keywords: prenatal stress, maternal stress, DNA methylation, telomere length",
    "Results": "3.1. Pregnancy Outcome Both UVPS and Control dams gave birth at the expected time, during the period spanning late G21 through early G22. Litter sizes ranged from 11–16 for the UVPS group and 11–17 for the Control group. A Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test indicated that the median UVPS ranks, Mdn=13.5, were significantly lower than the median Control ranks, Mdn = 15.5 (W=0, p < 0.05). 3.2. Bdnf IV DNA methylation To assess the effects of UVPS on adult DNA methylation patterns, we measured methylation of Bdnf IV in adult (PN90) male and female rats. The primer set we used targeted 3 CG sites that are upstream of the exon start site, encompassing a transcription factor binding site, and 8 CG sites within the beginning of the exon. We targeted this region as there are ample data indicating that this portion of DNA is especially sensitive to a range of physical or psychosocial factors ( Kundakovic et al., 2013 ; Lubin et al., 2008 ; Roth et al., 2009 ; Roth et al., 2014 ; Roth et al., 2011 ). Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) UVPS males had higher levels of methylation in the mPFC ( Figure 1A ). A two-way ANOVA comparing average methylation values for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction (F 1,19 =18.19, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher overall methylation than control males (t 19 =3.512, p=0.01) and UVPS females (t 19 =3.374, p=0.02). UVPS males also had higher methylation at several individual CG sites. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 1 for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction (F 1,19 =16.66, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t 19 =3.165, p=0.03) and UVPS females (t 19 =3.552, p=0.01). A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 2 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F 1,19 =12.31, p<0.01), but all post hoc analyses failed to reach statistical significance. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 3 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F 1,19 =16.75, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t 19 =2.921, p=0.05) and UVPS females (t 19 =3.366, p=0.02). A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 4 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant main effect of treatment (F 1,17 =13.75 p<0.01), sex (F 1,17 =6.453, p=0.02), and an interaction (F 1,17 =25.35, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t 17 =6.052, p<0.01), control females (t 17 =4.325, p<0.01), and UVPS females (t 17 =5.477, p<0.01). Finally, a two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at CG site 7 for both treatment and sex revealed a significant interaction (F 1,19 =14.38, p<0.01). UVPS males had higher methylation than control males (t 19 =3.452, p=0.02) and UVPS females (t 19 =3.145, p=0.03). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the medial prefrontal cortex. UVPS male offspring had significantly higher methylation compared to control males and UVPS females across most CG sites within the medial prefrontal cortex. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001; n=6–7/sex/condition; error bars represent SEM. Dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala There were no main effects of treatment or sex, nor any interaction effects for average methylation levels or methylation at individual CG sites within the dorsal or ventral hippocampus or central/basolateral amygdala. A two-way ANOVA comparing methylation values at individual sites within the ventral hippocampus for both treatment (UVPS vs. control) and sex (males vs. females) revealed a significant interaction at CG site 1 (F 1,22 =5.672, p=0.03) and CG site 2 (F 1,21 =4.935, p=0.04), but all post hoc analyses failed to reach statistical significance. 3.3. Bdnf IV gene expression As one way to envision the functional relevance of our changes in DNA methylation induced by UVPS within the mPFC, we measured steady-state gene expression of Bdnf IV -containing transcripts. No significant differences in Bdnf IV mRNA levels were detected between UVPS males and controls (t 6 =1.900, p=0.11) nor UVPS females and controls (t 6 =1.693, p=0.14). These data however do not necessarily mean our observed methylation changes are not functionally relevant in terms of gene expression. DNA methylation changes do not always result in steady-state changes in gene expression, but can instead prime transcriptional responses to subsequent stimuli and neural activation ( Baker-Andresen et al., 2013b ). Thus these methylation changes may be functionally relevant in terms of activity-dependent gene expression, which would occur for example when an animal is challenged with a stressor or learning event. 3.4. Telomere length Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) telomere length UVPS had a significant effect on telomere length in the mPFC ( Figure 2 ). A two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of treatment (UVPS vs. control) on telomere length in the mPFC (F 1,22 =7.847, p=0.01), with a shorter telomere length present in animals that experienced UVPS. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Telomere length in the adult medial prefrontal cortex. Animals that experienced UVPS had significantly shorter telomeres compared to controls. **p=0.01; n=6–7/sex/condition; error bars represent SEM. Ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, and amygdala telomere length In the hippocampus and central/basolateral amygdala there were no main effects of treatment or sex, nor any interaction effects on telomere length. 3.5. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) telomerase mRNA Given the differences observed in telomere length within the mPFC, we also wanted to selectively examine telomerase mRNA in this brain region. No significant differences in telomerase mRNA were detected between UVPS males vs. controls (t 6 =1.807, p=0.12) or UVPS females compared to control females (t 6 =2.265, p=0.06).",
    "Conclusion": "Here we used a rodent model of unpredictable, variable prenatal stress to test the hypothesis that a stressful environment in utero can render epigenetic and telomeric changes in the brain of offspring. We observed that Bdnf IV DNA methylation patterns in offspring at age PN90 varied depending on prenatal condition, sex, and brain region. Specifically, males from prenatally stressed mothers had significantly higher levels of methylation in the mPFC compared to male controls and females from prenatally stressed mothers. No differences in Bdnf IV DNA methylation were found in the dorsal hippocampus, ventral hippocampus, or amygdala in the stressed group compared to controls for either sex. Additionally, brain-region specific stress-induced effects on telomere length were detected with UVPS offspring exhibiting shorter telomeres in the mPFC. While decades of research have shown the detrimental effects of prenatal stress on brain function and behavior, there remains much to elucidate regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. A large drawback of this field as a whole is the variance in prenatal stress paradigms used, which makes direct comparisons between studies difficult ( Bock et al., 2015 ). The timing of gestational stress, predictability of stressor, and the stressors used vary greatly between studies, but are extremely important factors when considering the neurobiological changes induced by prenatal stress. Studying PN21 and PN80 male offspring of pregnant rats subjected to a different variable stress paradigm (beginning on G14, dams were subjected to a mixture of restraint stress, forced swim, cold exposure, social stress, and light exposure overnight) than the one we employed here, another lab found that prenatally stressed males at both ages had higher Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the amygdala and hippocampus (only a site-specific change at PN80) ( Boersma et al., 2014 ). One CG site showed higher methylation within the PFC of prenatally stressed males at PN21, however no methylation differences were detected in the PFC of PN80 offspring ( Boersma et al., 2014 ). Studying PN75 male offspring of pregnant mice subjected to restraint stress under bright light conditions (45 minutes three times per day from G7 through delivery), another lab observed significantly higher levels of methylation (as well as hydroxymethylation) for DNA associated with Bdnf IV in the frontal cortex ( Dong et al., 2015 ). Finally, studying PN90 male and female offspring of pregnant mice exposed to predator stress (from G11–18 dams were daily exposed to three different predator urines), another lab found lower methylation of Bdnf IV DNA (at only one CG site) in the hippocampus of female offspring ( St-Cyr and McGowan, 2015 ). Differences between these studies and ours may be attributable to differences in the type and timing of prenatal stress. Our study is unique in that we employed a block randomized program of three stressors (light, sound, and restraint) presented early- and mid-day during the lights on phase of the cycle and once during the dark phase for varying durations ranging from 15 to 60 minutes for the entire span of gestation. In addition, examining methylation within the entire prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus instead of the specific divisions within could produce different results. Nonetheless, data altogether are consistent with the notion that stress experienced by the dam is able to produce long-term epigenetic changes in offspring at a gene well-linked to neuroplasticity and cognition (e.g.( Bekinschtein et al., 2008 ; Dincheva et al., 2016 ; Martinowich et al., 2007 ; McEwen et al., 2015 )) and mental health (e.g.( Fuchikami et al., 2011 ; Keller et al., 2010 ; Perroud et al., 2013 ; Smith et al., 2011 )). Our study and that from the McGowan lab shed light on the sex-specific epigenetic changes inducible by intrauterine exposure to stress. Here we also found that prenatally stressed animals exhibited shorter telomeres in the mPFC compared to controls. A number of studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between early-life stress, reduced peripheral telomere length, and future mental-health ( Entringer et al., 2011 ; Marchetto et al., 2016 ; Shalev et al., 2014b ). The effects of stress on telomere length in the brain are less clear ( Thomas et al., 2008 ). Telomeres shorten with age in the cortex of rodents, but this shortening likely reflects changes occurring within glial cells given their increased mitotic potential relative to neurons ( Flanary and Streit, 2003 ; Linkus et al., 2016 ; Szebeni et al., 2014 ). We did not distinguish between neurons and glia in measuring telomere length or methylation in the present study, although recent studies from our lab suggest that developmental (postnatal) stress induces changes in mPFC Bdnf IV DNA methylation primarily in neurons ( Blaze and Roth, 2017 ). Rats selectively bred for enhanced depressive-like symptoms (i.e., the Flinders-sensitive line) show reduced telomere length in the hippocampus ( Wei et al., 2015 ) - supporting a role for telomere shortening in the brain. In contrast, other studies have found that postnatal stress (e.g., maternal separation or caregiver maltreatment) is associated with longer telomeres in the ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex ( Asok et al., 2014 ; Botha et al., 2012 ). The findings here complement our previous work with regard to stress effects on a common brain region (i.e., the mPFC), but differ in the direction of telomere change. Similar to methylation, it is likely that the type (maltreatment vs. maternal separation vs. variable stress) and timing (pre- vs. postnatal) of stress can differentially affect brain telomere length, and future studies are certainly warranted to better understand the parameters affecting brain telomere length. How our telomere data functionally link to our methylation data is not known, but telomerase activity is necessary for the cell survival-promoting effects of BDNF in neurons ( Fu et al., 2002 ). Further evidence of a putative link between BDNF and telomeres is the observation of a reduction in hippocampal telomerase activity, telomere length, and Bdnf expression in a rodent model of depression ( Wei et al., 2015 ). In summary our findings highlight the capacity of in utero stress to leave its epigenetic and telomeric mark within specific regions of the brain, providing important new insights into how gestational stress may have far reaching behavioral consequences for progeny. Indeed, behavioral analysis of the prenatally stressed and non-stressed subjects used in this report revealed robust sex-specific (male-biased) effects on anxiety responses (Ronca, unpublished). These findings are consistent with reports that prenatal stress leads to heightened stress sensitivity, especially among males ( Bronson and Bale, 2014 ), including studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms ( Koenig et al., 2005 ; Wilson et al., 2013 ). In accord with previous research linking prenatal stress with changes in body weight regulation and metabolic disorders ( Boersma et al., 2014 ; Wilson et al., 2013 ), adult body weights of prenatally stressed male (but not female) offspring of the present study were significantly elevated relative to non-stressed offspring (Ronca, unpublished). Our findings indicate that, in addition to brain epigenetic and telomeric changes, unpredictable, variable gestational stress exerts clear sex-specific programming effects on the physical and behavioral health of the offspring. It is unclear whether our data reported here are consistent with the notion that males are more susceptible or females are more resilient to stress, but evidence for sex-based vulnerability and resilience to a variety of stressors continues to grow ( Goel et al., 2011 ; Pfau and Russo, 2015 ; Radley et al., 2015 ). The study reported herein provides seminal evidence in a rodent model for an enduring influence of prenatal stress on both brain DNA methylation and telomere length in adulthood. Going forward, the challenge will be to identify the specific role(s) of these molecular brain changes in relation to the diverse effects of early-life stressors. Recent progress characterizing physiological and structural changes in the brain associated with prenatal stress, and their sex-specificity, may provide important new insights. Neuronal changes are highly region-specific with the most dramatic changes occurring in limbic and prefrontal cortical areas, those involved in cognition and emotional behavior. Altered neurogenesis, neuronal density, neuronal arborization, dendritic architecture, synaptic connectivity, and myelination have all been reported in animal models of prenatal stress ( Bock et al., 2015 ; Schuurmans and Kurrasch, 2013 ; Soztutar et al., 2016 ). Prenatal stress also disrupts sex-specific maturation of the PFC that normally occurs in adolescence ( Markham et al., 2013 ), thus our results could reflect not only sensitivity of the developing PFC to gestational stress but also a disruption of normative periadolescent maturation. Telomere length may be related to cellular changes in a variety of cell-types throughout the brain, including glia ( Dabouras et al., 2004 ; Leventopoulos et al., 2007 ). Relating cellular alterations to epigenetic and telomeric changes in specific brain regions (including those epigenetic and telomeric observations reported here, and of course other presumed concomitant changes) are certain to produce a deeper understanding of the far-reaching effects of prenatal stress. While extensive progress has been made in the understanding of the role of early-life adversity in the development of psychiatric and metabolic disorders, more detailed research on sex-specific, epigenetic, brain structural and behavioral changes is warranted. In particular, consistency across gestational stress paradigms, including the predictability and timing of stressor, the use of common behavioral and endpoint measures, and comparisons between male and females are vital for uncovering consistent and meaningful patterns of neurobiological changes induced by prenatal stress. Our present findings may have relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to early developmental programming, intergenerational epigenetic transmission of environmental exposures, and telomere biology. Illuminating molecular mechanisms underlying multigenerational programming of stress responses and mental and physical health outcomes are important first steps toward establishing therapeutic interventions to halt the generational persistence of pathological outcomes associated with early life adversity.",
