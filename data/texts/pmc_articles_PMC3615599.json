    "Abstract": "Abstract Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1 ) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2 ) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.

The efficacy of the training program was confirmed with a significant increase in citrate synthase activity of the soleus in both young (YSed, 15 ± 2 μmol·g −1 ·min −1 ; YET, 20 ± 2 μmol·g −1 ·min −1 ; P < 0.05) and old (OSed, 14 ± 2 μmol·g −1 ·min −1 ; OET, 19 ± 2 μmol·g −1 ·min −1 ; P < 0.05) groups.

Intra-abdominal AT blood flow and vascular conductance at rest and during exercise. In the sedentary animals at rest, there was lower AT blood flow in the old group vs. younger counterparts ( Fig. 1 A ). Exercise training significantly elevated adipose perfusion at rest in both age groups and abolished age-related differences in resting flow ( Fig. 1 A ). Vascular conductance measured at rest paralleled blood flow measures in all groups ( Fig. 1 B ). During the steady state of exercise, there was a significantly higher AT blood flow in OSed vs. YSed ( Fig. 2 A ). Exercise training resulted in an elevated adipose perfusion during exercise to YET and a reduced flow to OET vs. sedentary counterparts ( Fig. 2 A ); age-related differences in adipose blood flow were no longer present. Despite small differences in arterial pressure among groups during exercise ( Table 1 ), vascular conductance measures paralleled those of blood flow among groups ( Fig. 2 B ). When comparing vascular conductance responses during the transition from rest to exercise, all groups showed significant differences, albeit there was a directionally opposite response in the OSed vs. YSed groups. Specifically, compared with resting values, there was an ∼55% decrease in vascular conductance in YSed and an ∼110% increase in vascular conductance in OSed during exercise ( Fig. 3 ). After exercise training, both OET and YET demonstrated a similar decrease (∼50%) in vascular conductance from rest to exercise, and age-related differences were abolished ( Fig. 3 ). Fig. 1.

The maximal diameter and spontaneous tone of resistance arteries from intra-abdominal AT are listed in Table 1 . Compared with YSed, there was a tendency for a greater maximal diameter and significantly less tone in intra-abdominal AT arteries from the OSed group. After exercise training, there were no differences in maximal diameter or spontaneous tone between age groups ( Table 1 ). Tone was significantly greater in OET vs. OSed. Vasoconstrictor responses. NE elicited a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries from all groups ( Fig. 4 A ). The constriction evoked by NE was significantly lower in OSed vs. YSed, and exercise training resulted in a significantly greater contractile response to NE in OET vs. OSed ( Fig. 4 A ). There was a greater vasoconstriction after exercise training, only at the highest concentration (10 −4 M) in YET (59 ± 4%) vs. YSed (45 ± 4%, P < 0.05) and OET (46 ± 6%, P < 0.05). There was a lower sensitivity to NE in OSed vs. YSed ( Table 1 ). There were no differences in sensitivity to NE between YET and OET, although there was an enhanced sensitivity in OET vs. OSed ( Table 1 ). PE produced similar concentration-dependent, contractile responses in AT-resistance arteries from all groups ( Fig. 4 B ). Vasoconstrictor responses to PE were diminished in OSed vs. YSed, and exercise training enhanced contractile responses to PE in the old group but did not significantly affect that of the young group ( Fig. 4 B ) vs. age-matched sedentary counterparts. Although there were no group response differences to PE between YET and OET, the constriction elicited by 10 −5 and 10 −4 M PE was greater in the YET (55 ± 4 and 64 ± 5%, respectively) vs. OET (44 ± 4 and 49 ± 5%, respectively; P < 0.05). There was a lower sensitivity to PE in OSed vs. YSed ( Table 1 ). Exercise training did not affect sensitivity to PE in the young group but enhanced sensitivity significantly in OET vs. OSed ( Table 1 ). There were no differences in sensitivity to PE between the trained groups ( Table 1 ). Fig. 4.

In the sedentary group, at all pressures above zero, the active diameter was significantly larger in arteries from OSed vs. YSed ( Fig. 5 ). Exercise training abolished age-related differences in the active myogenic response among groups ( Fig. 5 A ).

    "Conclusion": "The overall purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that old age-related vascular dysfunction in AT would adversely affect the ability to redistribute blood flow away from AT during exercise. In support of our hypothesis, there was an increase in AT blood flow and vascular conductance during exercise in old rats, whereas there was a decrease in AT blood flow and vascular conductance in young, healthy controls ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). To investigate potential mechanisms for this disparate blood flow response to AT during exercise, we measured AT-resistance artery contractile responses to α-adrenergic and myogenic stimuli, both of which were found to be diminished in the OSed vs. YSed group ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). After chronic aerobic training, the directional change and magnitude of AT perfusion and vascular conductance from rest to exercise were similar between young and old groups ( Figs. 1 – 3 ). Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in both intra-abdominal AT arterial α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction with old age after exercise training. It is likely that the inability to rapidly divert blood flow away from AT with old age contributes to reductions in arterial pressure during orthostatic challenges ( 61 ) and heat stress ( 38 ), as well as altered whole-body hemodynamics during physical activity ( 39 ). However, after exercise training, many of the old, age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vasoconstrictor responses in adipose-resistance arteries were abolished. This suggests that an enhanced ability to centrally mobilize blood volume from AT after chronic training may be a contributing mechanism to the enhanced muscle blood flow during exercise ( 6 ) and the increased ability to tolerate orthostatic challenges ( 49 ) in older individuals. Regulation of AT blood flow. AT blood flow is intricately linked to metabolism for adequate substrate and humoral delivery ( 64 ) and is tightly regulated through autonomic and endocrine signaling, as well as intrinsic autoregulatory mechanisms of AT-resistance vessels ( 75 ). Electrical stimulation of nerves innervating inguinal white AT elicits a robust vasoconstriction that is abolished by α-adrenergic receptor blockade ( 54 ), suggesting an immediate decrease in AT vascular conductance with enhanced SNS activity. However, AT vascular responses to systemic intravenous infusion of NE produce conflicting results that appear to be time dependent. For example, experiments that elevate systemic NE concentrations in humans (all of which result in elevated arterial pressure) demonstrate a decreased ( 32 ) or increased ( 40 ) vascular conductance and augmented blood flow ( 60 ) in subcutaneous AT. In the latter two studies, it should be noted that despite plasma NE concentrations reaching a steady state within 5–10 min, significant changes in AT blood flow did not occur until 15–30 min after NE infusion began, thus suggesting that a prolonged exposure is required to elicit changes in vascular conductance. In the current study, we observe a robust vasoconstriction in resistance arteries from centrally located intra-abdominal AT in the young group to both NE and PE ( Fig. 4 , A and B , respectively), which is in contrast to some human data showing an increased AT vascular conductance to systemically elevated NE levels ( 40 ). The reasons for the disparate findings between the isolated vessel rapid contraction to NE and studies showing an increased adipose perfusion to elevated systemic NE over longer time frames ( 60 ) are unknown but may be related to tissue-specific vascular properties (peripheral vs. central) or the large elevation in arterial pressure with systemic NE infusion ( 40 , 60 ) concomitant with the loss of myogenic autoregulation at higher transmural pressures in AT-resistance vessels ( 75 ). The effect of exercise on AT blood flow appears to be dependent largely on the duration of exercise. In the current study, there was a reduction in blood flow ( Fig. 2 A ) and vascular conductance ( Fig. 3 ) when transitioning from rest to exercise in young, healthy subjects, due, in part, to an active vasoconstriction in AT. This observation is consistent with other studies that demonstrate an immediate (≤5 min) decrease in perfusion of epididymal ( 45 ) adipose depots and subcutaneous fat [( 45 ), and see Armstrong et al. ( 2 ) for exception] during dynamic whole-body exercise. However, with longer durations of exercise, blood flow to AT increases, likely consequent to an increased delivery of free fatty acids from AT ( 25 ), suggesting that any initial vasoconstriction during exercise onset is modified later by circulating humoral or endocrine factors ( 25 ) and possibly tachyphylaxia of adrenergic receptors ( 66 ). Given that stimulation of nerves innervating white AT simultaneously enhance lipolysis rate and induce a strong vasoconstriction ( 54 ), there may be an impaired release of free fatty acids during exercise. Indeed, upon the cessation of exercise, fatty acids are suddenly “washed out” of AT, which may be related to the release of vasoconstrictor tone manifest during exercise [reviewed in Frayn et al. ( 26 )]. Aging, exercise training, and AT function. In the current study, adipose blood flow was significantly lower at rest in old vs. young subjects. There are several potential mechanisms for the lower flow at rest with old age, including 1 ) diminished vascular endothelial function ( 8 , 17 , 63 ); 2 ) elevated oxidative stress from AT ( 4 ), which may diminish the bioavailabilty of nitric oxide; and 3 ) significantly elevated basal SNS activity with old age ( 53 ), offsetting a diminished α-adrenergic sensitivity ( Table 1 ). During submaximal exercise, the plasma NE responses are either similar ( 37 , 39 ) or smaller ( 31 ) in old vs. young subjects, which in combination with a diminished α-adrenergic vasoconstriction ( Fig. 4 ), likely contributes to the large increase in blood flow to AT during exercise in the OSed group. After exercise training, the AT blood flow response between age groups was largely normalized ( Figs. 1 and 2 ), which is associated with an elevated blood flow to oxidative skeletal muscle during exercise ( 10 ). Without measurement of cardiac output, the precise relationship between the reduced AT observed herein and the elevated skeletal muscle blood flow with aging after training ( 10 ) cannot be determined and warrants future investigations. In healthy, young men, exercise training does not appear to alter adipose perfusion, as there are no differences in AT blood flow between sedentary and endurance-trained subjects at rest ( 67 ), despite a greater blood flow response to AT with adrenaline infusion after training ( 68 ). In the current study, at rest, there was an enhanced blood flow to AT in both age groups after endurance training vs. age-matched sedentary counterparts ( Fig. 1 A ). Although not measured in the current study, there are several potential mechanisms responsible for changes in AT blood flow after training, including 1 ) alterations in plasma NE concentrations, 2 ) changes in the expression or location of adipose vascular adrenergic receptors, and 3 ) enhanced adipose vessel endothelial function. Changes in sympathetic nerve activity or differences in plasma NE concentrations affecting resistance artery function are unlikely, as endurance training has little effect on resting sympathetic nerve activity ( 62 ) with lower ( 34 ) or unchanged ( 12 , 58 ) plasma NE concentrations after training. Given that AT blood flow is influenced largely by α-adrenergic receptor function (1a), differences in the expression of adrenergic receptors (e.g., diminished α 1 -receptor density with old age) among groups could contribute to differences in adipose blood flow. Given that both aging ( 8 , 17 , 63 ) and obesity ( 20 ) diminish resistance artery endothelial function, it is likely that improvements in endothelial function after exercise training ( 47 , 56 , 63 ) contributed to the greater AT perfusion at rest. During the transition from rest to exercise with old age, the AT blood flow response was directionally opposite (reduction in flow) in the exercise-trained vs. sedentary group (increased flow vs. rest; Figs. 1 A and 2 A ). The AT blood flow response in old age after training suggests an enhanced vasoconstriction within the AT-resistance vasculature. Indeed, in AT-resistance arteries, there was an enhanced α-adrenergic ( Fig. 4 , A and B ) and myogenic ( Fig. 5 A ) vasoconstriction after training with old age. We are unaware of any other studies that have looked specifically at the effects of aging and/or exercise training on adipose-resistance artery function. However, exercise training has been shown to enhance α-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction within tissue that is not recruited during exercise (i.e., shows no net hyperemic response) ( 43 ), suggesting a possible systemic effect on adrenergic receptor function. There is also evidence that exercise training enhances myogenic vasoconstriction ( 17 ), which was demonstrated in the old group after training ( Fig. 5 A ). The precise mechanisms for the altered AT-resistance artery vasoconstriction observed herein remain to be determined but likely contribute to an increased ability to mobilize free fatty acids after exercise training ( 13 , 69 ). Conclusions. In summary, α-adrenergic receptor-mediated and myogenic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries are diminished with aging, which was associated with an increase in AT blood flow during exercise in the OSed group. Exercise training augmented adrenergic vasoconstriction in adipose arteries with old age, which likely contributed, in part, to the reduction in adipose blood flow during exercise relative to sedentary counterparts. An age-associated deficit in α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT may contribute to the impaired baroreflex buffering with old age ( 35 , 76 ) and result in a spatial overperfusion of AT during exercise. Whereas the possibility that a blunted adipose vasoconstriction with old age diminishes the ability to redistribute blood flow to the active muscles during exercise in humans is likely, elegant studies are required to address this issue mechanistically.",
