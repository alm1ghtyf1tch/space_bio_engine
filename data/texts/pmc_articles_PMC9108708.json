    "Abstract": "COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has claimed approximately 5 million lives and 257 million cases reported globally. This virus and disease have significantly affected people worldwide, whether directly and/or indirectly, with a virulent ...",
    "Results": "SARS-CoV-2 infection of human monocytes [ 55 ] and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial (HPAEpiC) cells [ 56 ] induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production, increased HIF-1α protein levels and upregulated expression of HIF-1α target genes [ 57 ]. The stability of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) during a SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 replication [ 55 – 57 ]. The expression of ORF3a in human embryonic kidney 293 T-antigen cells (HEK293T) cells increased the stability of HIF-1α and induced mROS production, which is an activator of HIF-1α. Together these results suggest that ORF3a induces mROS production to activate HIF-1α, which in turn triggers a shift in cellular metabolism to favor glycolysis, resulting in increased viral replication and transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Following host cell infection, the SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription complex synthesizes ~30 kb viral genomes as well as the subgenomic RNAs required to encode for viral structural and mechanistic proteins. Between 1–5 h post-infection, the percentage of coronavirus-encoded protein per total cellular protein translation may increase by as much as 20,000 times, with the fraction of viral to cellular RNA ultimately reaching as high as 90% intracellularly [ 58 ]. To accommodate this huge shift towards viral replication, there is certainly a requirement of a shift in cellular metabolism to accommodate for viral synthesis. An investigation of SARS-CoV-2 metabolism during the initial 48-hours post viral infection showed that amino acid availability and synthesis are altered, de novo purine synthesis intermediates are accumulated, intracellular glucose and folate are depleted, and lactate levels are elevated [ 59 ]. This suggests a viral strategy of upregulating purine metabolism at the post-translational level to coincide with the shutting off of the majority of host proteins at translation levels. Virus-infected cells also commonly exhibit the Warburg effect - increased glycolytic metabolism in the presence of inadequate oxygen for oxidative phosphorylation - to supply reducing equivalents and precursors for macromolecule biosynthesis, and to support generation of ATP needed for also increasing nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis. Metabolic shifts include dysregulated Ca 2+ signaling and increased mitochondrial generation of ROS. How SARS-CoV-2 induces host cell nucleotide metabolism remains unanswered. Mitochondrial metabolism and function are highly impacted in multiple ways. With the shift towards glycolysis, there is a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation affecting the mitochondria and its function. SARS-CoV-2 may interact with the mitochondria to destabilize its oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Coronavirus replication requires the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These DMVs serve as a site for viral replication and help conceal the virus from host cellular defenses. Interestingly, mitochondrial stress is known to induce mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) that communicate with the ER. It is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 disruption of mitochondrial function results in the induction of (double-membrane) MDVs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA present in the mitochondria induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased DMVs can provide opportunity for viruses to hide and replicate [ 60 ]. SARS-CoV-2 and all subgenomic RNAs are enriched in the host mitochondria, and viral genome’s 5ʹ - and 3ʹ -UTRs contain distinct mitochondrial localization signals [ 61 ], indicating that the viral RNA may hijack the mitochondria, an interesting hypothesis for experimental validation [ 61 ]. Other recent studies have mapped physical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins with mitochondrial localized proteins. These interactions include: NSP8 interaction with mitochondrial ribosomal protein s2 (MRPS2), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s5 (MRPS5), mitochondrial ribosomal protein s25 (MRPS25), and mitochondrial ribosomal protein s27 (MRPS27) ribosomal proteins; ORF9c interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 1 (NDUFAF1) and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 9 (NDUFB9); ORF10 interaction with TIMM8; and NSP7 interaction with mitochondrial NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 2 (NDUFAF2). NDUFAF1, NDUFAF2, NDUFB9, and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Complex Assembly Factor 10 (NDUFA10) are all key players in the assembly of complex I, and NDUFA10 is suggested as being one of the master regulators of the SARS-CoV-2 pathology [ 7 ]. Interactions were also observed between viral M protein and ATPase Na + /K + Transporting Subunit Beta 1 (ATP1B1), ATPase H + Transporting V1 Subunit A (ATP6V1A), acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (ACADM), Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Beta (PMPCB), Pitrilysin Metallopeptidase 1 (PITRM1), Coenzyme Q8B (COQ8B), and Peptidase, Mitochondrial Processing Subunit Alpha (PMPCA); these proteins are each components of critical mitochondrial metabolic pathways. SARS-CoV-2-encoded ORF9b protein interacts and localizes with Translocase Of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 70 (TOMM70) [ 7 ], a mitochondrial import receptor important for transporting proteins into mitochondria and, more importantly, in modulating anti-viral cellular defense pathways [ 62 ]. These mitochondrial interactions offer glimpses of the viral effect on glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways and the potential side effects. Another example of COVID-19’s mitochondrial-related impacts is the over-production of cellular ROS [ 63 ]. ROS and reactive nitrogen species have diverse functions in biological systems; oxidatively attacking pathogens, regulating cell proliferation, and key signaling functions [ 64 ]. However, dysregulation of ROS is implicated in many diseases, including the hyper-inflammatory late phase of COVID-19 [ 65 ]. As a part of normal redox metabolism, superoxide radicals are converted into hydrogen peroxide by the action of superoxide dismutase. The hydrogen peroxide is subsequently broken down into water by glutathione peroxidase. During COVID-19, isoforms of enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, may be directly targeted and proteolyzed by the SARS-CoV-2 protease, Mpro. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to suppress the ROS-associated Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage. Dysregulation of the Nrf2 pathway will exacerbate the pro-oxidative stress caused by the virus [ 66 ]. SARS-CoV-2 may suppress the accumulation of the selenoprotein transcripts, which are crucial for the correct functioning of Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) and mitochondria function [ 67 ]. This redox impairment would lead to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide, which could trigger inflammation by promoting the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF-κB, and the nuclear NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [ 68 ]. Due to the multiple effects of SARS-CoV-2 that alter cellular metabolic and oxidative states, there are multiple directions to deplete NAD+, loss of cellular ATP and reduced Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) activity, each of which have cytotoxic effects of their own [ 69 ]. In general, NADPH, synthesized from NAD+, is necessary for many key redox reactions; a reduced level of NADPH could play a mechanistic role in cellular metabolic changes from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
    "Conclusion": "The causative agent of the COVID-19 the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, has caused loss of incomes, economic crises, morbidities, and loss of life worldwide. Here, we describe the virus and review state-of-the-art information about the processes it utilizes to enter and reprogram the human host machinery. We detail research on early infection using evidence from patient samples, organoids and cells, and non-human animal studies. Each of these has limitations but taken together provide unique observational and mechanistic insight on SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 is a pleiotropic condition. Viral insults and subsequent cellular metabolic adaptations differ in the context of cell-type, genotype and environmental influences. Thus, much of what we have presented applies to specific cell types and contexts, and we have attempted to cover these contexts. Key avenues of future research on SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation include: 1) defining the mechanisms of how the virus enters cells, and the protein and receptor molecules that are critical to this process; 2) elucidating the dynamics of how protein machinery is captured and retrofitted for viral purposes in a cell-specific manner; 3) understanding how the host genetics and environment can affect the ability of the virus to infect; 4) understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; and 5) revealing how the mitochondria adapts to ultimately shift its physiology from steady-state. In the best-case scenario for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, infection leads to a cascade of intracellular adaptations in which multiple networks are remodeled, from transcription to metabolism to signal transduction, shifting the invaded host cell from its original physiology into a SARS-CoV-2 replication system, and causing the emission of new viral particles and signaling molecules. The subsequent disease events will reverberate across the body’s cells and organs. This will be the subject of our Part 2 review (in preparation).",
