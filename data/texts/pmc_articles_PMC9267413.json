    "Abstract": "Abstract Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight. Keywords: space exploration, microgravity, space radiation, astronaut health, female reproductive system, gynecological cancers",
    "Results": "There is no definitive evidence of increased rates of carcinogenesis amongst astronauts exposed to space radiation in comparison to terrestrial controls (likely because of their overall excellent health pre-flight, low overall doses experienced to date, and very small sample sizes) [ 90 ]. However, it is reasonable to assume that space radiation would increase an astronautâ€™s individualized risk [ 30 ]. Furthermore, when reviewing astronaut and analog populations of aircrews exposed to cosmic radiation, Di Trolio et al. concluded that it was unclear whether increased exposure to cosmic radiation was directly linked to carcinogenic risk or whether the risk may be more attributable to lifestyle factors [ 91 ].",
    "Conclusion": "The current data reveal a scarcity of knowledge about the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, as there have been insufficient numbers of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation to reliably determine the impact on the female reproductive system. With the upcoming Artemis missions set to place the first females on the Moon, there will be longer duration of exposures to both microgravity and space radiation; hence, the influence of flight length on risks related to gynecological cancers will demand a larger focus in ensuring astronaut safety during flight and postflight. Indeed, among all body tissues, the male and female gonads are among the most sensitive to radiation. Therefore, these tissues may be one of the best to study to determine space radiation related exposures.",
