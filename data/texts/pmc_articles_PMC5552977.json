    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The draft genome sequences of six Bacillus strains, isolated from the International Space Station and belonging to the Bacillus anthracis - B. cereus - B. thuringiensis group, are presented here. These strains were isolated from the Japanese Experiment Module (one strain), U.S. Harmony Node 2 (three strains), and Russian Segment Zvezda Module (two strains).",
    "Results": "Accession number(s). The complete genome sequences were deposited in NCBI under the accession numbers listed in Table 1 and can be accessed from the NASA GeneLab system (GLDS-64; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-64 ).",
    "Conclusion": "Accession number(s). The complete genome sequences were deposited in NCBI under the accession numbers listed in Table 1 and can be accessed from the NASA GeneLab system (GLDS-64; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-64 ).",
