    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR 5-ion ) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation. Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p -value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p -value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR 5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR 5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

    "Results": "Cardiac and plasma protein abundance and phosphorylation are modestly diminished at 9 months post GCR 5-ion exposure For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs ( Supplementary Table S1 ); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides ( Supplementary Table S3 ); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed in order to observe any high-level differences between sample groups ( Figures 2A–C ). The heart proteome ( Figure 2A ) and heart phosphoproteome ( Figure 2C ) were better separated (sham irradiated versus GCR 5-ion irradiated) as judged by the two most prominent components (PC1 versus PC2), whereas the plasma proteome from the sham and GCR 5-ion irradiated animals were not as well separated by PC1 and PC2 ( Figure 2B ). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Visualization of proteome and phosphoproteome data sets Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of heart proteome (A) ; plasma proteome (B) ; and phosphoproteome (C) . Heatmap clustering plot of heart proteome (D) ; plasma proteome (E) ; and phosphoproteome (F) . Clustering of top 20 proteins in each data set. Proteins are selected based on fold-change difference between GCR 5-ion vs. control samples. From the list of significantly changed proteins, we chose the top 20 based on fold change values to create a heatmap as shown in Figures 2D, E (see also Tables 1 – 3 for more details). The top three DEPs in the cardiac proteome were ATP synthase-coupling factor 6, mitochondrial (ATP5J; AdjPval = 1.53E-28), Troponin C, slow skeletal and cardiac muscles (TNNC1; AdjPval 5.20E-27), and Calmodulin-2 (CALM2; AdjPval = 7.44E-16). The 20 most significant DEPs in the cardiac proteome ( Table 1 ) are involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses, complement activation, calmodulin binding, mitochondrial function, and cardiac contraction. Interestingly, there were two S100 proteins (S100-A6 and S100-A9) in the top cardiac proteome DEPs. TABLE 1. Top 20 proteins: cardiac proteome.

The top 20 proteins in the cardiac phosphoproteome are involved in cardiac function, enzymatic activity, muscle contraction, regulation of transcription and translations, DNA repair, and regulation of neutrophil migration ( Table 3 ). For all three proteomics data sets, the majority of the DEPS were diminished in abundance in GCR 5-ion irradiated versus sham irradiated control animals ( Figure 3 ). In the proteome of the heart, there were 76 proteins that were significantly diminished in abundance and 11 proteins that were significantly increased in abundance. In the plasma proteome, there was only one protein with increased abundance after radiation. In the phosphopeptide data set, there were 43 phosphopeptides that were decreased in abundance after radiation and 17 phosphopeptides that increased post radiation. FIGURE 3.

Bar graph showing the number of significantly up- and downregulated proteins for heart proteome (D) ; plasma proteome (E) ; and phosphoproteomc (F) . A single dose of GCR 5-ion permanently changed numerous biological pathways in the heart and plasma The results from both the abundance and phosphoproteomics data sets indicated that there were a number of proteins significantly changed in abundance in response to GCR 5-ion . Each data set was analyzed using a bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach, as outlined in the Materials and Methods, to map these changes to cellular location, protein function, and biological pathways. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways affected at 0.1 FDR cutoff. See Supplementary Table S4–S8 for details on all pathways emerging from the bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach. For the heart proteome, the major upregulated enriched pathways were: inflammatory processes (including coagulation cascade, complement cascade), elastic fibers, amino acid metabolism, citric acid cycle, extracellular matrix interactions, integrins, cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, urea cycle, HNF-3B/FOXA2 pathway, and metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins ( Figure 4A ). Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the heart proteome were: cell cycle/transcription (CCTR), HIV life cycle, iron uptake and transport, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, insulin glucose pathways, mitochondrial functions (including oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport system), and keratinization/cornification ( Figure 4C ). The CCTR pathway contained the most proteins and Supplementary Figure S1 shows the complete pathway interaction maps for CCTR. Each of the 72 circles represents a pathway in the interaction map with the size of the circle proportional to the number of proteins annotated with each pathway. Two interacting pathways are connected by a line with the thickness of the line proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways. FIGURE 4.

The thickness of the line is proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways. Pathways are annotated with the source database as Biocarta (BIC), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID). Major enriched pathways that were upregulated in the plasma samples from mice exposed to GCR 5-ion included oxidative damage, and metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, toxins, and steroids, toxins ( Figure 4B ). Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the plasma include inflammatory processes (complement cascade, coagulation), oxidative damage, and cardiac signaling (GPCR and Hippo) ( Figure 4D ). Inflammatory pathways and processes that were perturbed in both the heart and plasma proteome are examined in more detail in Figure 5 . In both the heart and plasma proteome data set, pathways related to inflammatory processes were in the top ten significantly modulated pathways of each ( Figures 5A, C ). A pathway enrichment map combining both data sets with a focus on the inflammation pathways was generated ( Figure 5B ). Interestingly, two patterns emerged from this analysis. First, for pathways that were commonly perturbed in the plasma and heart, the pathways were upregulated in the heart and downregulated in the plasma, as shown by the red top half representing the heart and the bottom blue half that representing the plasma. Second, inflammatory pathways that were only perturbed in the plasma were downregulated. FIGURE 5.

(B) Pathway enrichment map showing inflammation pathways that are perturbed in common in the heart and plasma proteome data sets. Each rectangle represents a pathway. The rectangle is split in two. The upper portion of the rectangle represents the heart data and lower half represents the plasma data. The size of the rectangle is proportional to the number of proteins annotated with the pathway. Two interacting pathways are connected by a line. The thickness of the line is proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways. Pathways are annotated with the source database as Biocarta (BIC), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways (WP), Reactome (RECT), and the Pathway Interaction Database (PID). Major enriched pathways that were significantly modulated in the phosphoproteomics data set of the heart included many pathways and processes involved in cardiac structure and function such as sarcomere, contractile fiber, I band, muscle cell development, contraction, actin binding, cardiac differentiation, and transmembrane transport. Other pathways significantly perturbed involved inflammatory processes such as neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species ( Figure 6A ). Kinases responsible for phosphorylation of major substrates are shown in the heatmap of kinase-substrate interaction ( Figure 6B ). Notably, MTOR, CAMKG2, and PIM3 emerged as the three kinases responsible for phosphorylating most of the major substrates examined in the analysis. There were 121 proteins that are common between the heart proteome and phosphoproteome ( Figure 6C ). Of these proteins, there were seven phosphopeptides that were significantly affected in only the phosphoprotome data set ( Figure 6D ), indicating that the differences in phosphopetpide abundance of these seven phosphopepitides were due to differential phosphorylation at these particular sites rather than differences in protein abundance. These proteins are: RTN2 (reticulon 2), LMOD2 (leiomodin 2), PP1R7 (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7), MTCH1 (mitochondrial carrier 1), LNP (lunapark), MIC60 (MICOS complex subunit Mic60), and JPH2 (Junctophilin-2).

Neutrophil extracellular traps were elevated in myocardium of GCR 5-ion irradiated mice 12 months post irradiation Western blot analysis was performed on mouse myocardium of 150 cGy GCR 5-ion irradiated mice at 12 months and age-matched sham irradiation control ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) to evaluate the expression patterns of selected proteins where antibodies were commercially available. Of the 13 protein targets examined by this methodology, only cytokeratin1 and fibrinogen gamma were statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice ( Supplementary Figure S2D ). Immunofluorescent staining of mouse myocardium for markers of inflammation was also performed. Shown in Supplementary Figure S3 are representative myocardial sections from mice irradiated with 150 cGy GCR 5-ion stained for fibrinogen α, fibrinogen β, C4d, and C4b-BP. There was no observed difference in the staining patterns of these protein markers between the GCR 5-ion irradiated and sham irradiated mice and there was no significant staining observed in any of the samples. To investigate the histologic presentation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the hearts of mice exposed to GCR 5-ion , immunofluorescent staining was performed using anti-neutrophil elastase and anti-MPO antibodies. The staining patterns were compared between the GCR 5-ion -exposed mice hearts and the hearts of control mice ( Figure 7A ). The colocalization of DAPI, MPO, and neutrophil elastase revealed positive staining for NETs in the myocardial tissue of GCR 5-ion -treated mice ( Figure 7B ). The NETs were found to be diffusely distributed in these heart sections, whereas no NETs were observed in any of the control mice hearts. FIGURE 7.

Immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess the presence of NETs in the hearts of mice exposed to 150 mGy of GCR 5-ion at 12 months post radiation, as compared to sham irradiated control mice hearts. (A) A robust and extensive distribution of NETs was observed in the myocardium of mice exposed to GCR 5-ion (upper panel), while no NETs were detected in the control mice hearts (lower panel).

The colocalization of extracellular DNA structure (DAPI), MPO, and elastase further confirmed the presence of NET structures (B) . The scale bar represents 50 μm.",
    "Conclusion": "Based on data from epidemiological studies, it takes a significant amount of time for cardiovascular disease to develop (up to decades). There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment. Here, we undertook a multi-proteomics approach to characterize protein and pathway perturbations that occurred in hearts and plasma from mice exposed to a single dose of GCR 5-ion 8 months prior. One of the most interesting observations was that across the three data sets, the abundance of the majority of the DEPs diminished in the heart and plasma at 8 months post radiation. While one acute effect of radiation is to cause fragmentation and aggregation of protein molecules ( Kumta and Tappel, 1961 ), it is possible that the effects observed at 8 months post radiation may be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that microgravity, another stressor of space travel, reduced protein turnover in cardiomyocytes ( Feger et al., 2016 ) and speculated that this diminishment in protein synthesis could lead to overall reduction in cardiomyocyte protein content. Calmodulin 2 (CALM2), a signaling protein involved in the calcium-regulated contraction of cardiac muscle ( Beghi et al., 2022 ), was one of the most highly perturbed proteins in the heart proteome in this study. We examined the expression levels of CALM2 as well as an associated kinase (CAMKG2) via Western blots but did not see a statistical difference in abundance of either protein in the hearts of GCR 5-ion irradiated mice compared to unirradiated controls ( Supplementary Figures S2A, S3C ). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were also performed on hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice to validate markers of complement activation (C4d and C4b-BP; Supplementary Figure S3 ) and coagulation/clotting/fibrin formation (fibrinogen alpha, fibrinogen beta, fibrinogen gamma; Supplementary Figures S2C, S3 ). From this analysis, only fibrinogen gamma was statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice as observed via Western blot analysis ( Supplementary Figure S2H ). In the plasma proteome, the most significantly regulated protein was major urinary protein 20 (MUP20) which was upregulated in irradiated animals. MUP20 is a male pheromone which promotes aggressive male behavior, stimulates female sexual attraction to male urinary scent, promotes a strong learned attraction to the airborne urinary odor of an individual male, and promotes spatial learning by rapidly conditioning preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent ( Roberts et al., 2010 ; Roberts et al., 2010 ; Demir et al., 2020 ). While this finding may not be translatable since humans are the only placental mammals found not to have any active MUP genes ( Logan et al., 2008 ), the finding of MUP20 dysregulation in male mice exposed to GCR 5-ion may illuminate behavioral and learning changes following exposures of rodents to various GCR components. Other proteins dysregulated in the plasma following GCR irradiation are serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) (upregulated) and glutathione S-transferase theta-3 (GSTT3) (downregulated). SAA1 is a major acute-phase protein mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to infection, tissue injury, and malignancy. SAA has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting platelet aggregation and by reducing the oxidative burst in Polymorphonuclear neutrophils( Zimlichman et al., 1990 ; Gatt et al., 1998 ). SAA also has proinflammatory effects, such as induction of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, allowing the repair of tissue damage and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-6, and TNFa ( Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999 ). GSTT3 is expressed strongly in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidney and testis). Glutathione transferases play a significant role in the metabolism/detoxification process of a wide range of electrophilic compounds that include mutagens, carcinogens, reactive oxygen species, and some therapeutic agents. The most highly impacted pathways in the heart tissue were inflammation/complement/coagulation, mitochondria, and cell cycle/transcription (CCTR). The downregulation of the mitochondrial pathways is in line with the comprehensive Azimzadeh et al. review of omics data from radiation induced-cardiovascular disease ( Azimzadeh et al., 2022 ). However, in our study, the CCTR cluster was the most highly affected, as detailed in Supplementary Figure S1 , which shows the 72 CCTR processes that are downregulated in the heart 8 months post GCR irradiation. This global downregulation in cell cycle and transcription processes may help explain the overall diminishment in protein abundance noted earlier in the discussion. Perhaps the most interesting finding from this study involves neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs have come to the forefront of immunology for their fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens. Beyond this defensive capacity, intriguingly, NETs have shown the ability to modulate inflammatory responses, even within sterile environments ( Papayannopoulos, 2018 ). One remarkable illustration of this involves the role of cholesterol crystals in prompting the formation of NETs, which subsequently stimulate macrophages to unleash IL-1-beta, a process known to expedite the development of atherosclerosis ( Warnatsch et al., 2015 ). This process becomes particularly concerning when a plaque rupture transpires. The resulting exposure of endovascular NETs can escalate vascular thrombosis, a factor intimately tied to severe cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction and stroke ( Klopf et al., 2021 ). Our study has unveiled some illuminating findings in this area. Employing proteomic analysis, we discovered that the NETs formation pathway was activated in mice exposed to Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), and myocardium sections exhibited a significant accumulation of NETs in these mice after long-term high-energy GCR exposure. Our findings align with previous research wherein, in a mouse bladder cancer model receiving radiation therapy, NETs were found to promote their formation through the protein HMGB1 via a TLR4-dependent pathway both in vitro and in vivo ( Shinde-Jadhav et al., 2021 ). Notably, the accumulation of NETs and its components in local areas can inflict damage on healthy tissues. Prior research has linked the increased expression of NETs in the inflamed myocardium to gene expression of collagen type I (Col1a1) and increased the heart stiffness in mouse models ( Bai et al., 2019 ). This correlation may explain our previous findings, which demonstrated decreased systolic heart function and increased arterial elastance 1 year after GCR exposure, as revealed through cardiac-pressure-volume loop analysis ( Bishawi et al., 2022 ). From our limited tissue samples, we observed an increased presence of type I collagen in the GCR-exposed mice, but no significant difference in type III collagen between the two groups (see Supplementary Figure S4 ). Evidence for persistent activity, as indicated by markers such as MPO and elastase, was noted 8 months post-exposure. However, this study did not include additional markers such as plasma enrichment, quantification of NETotic neutrophils, cleaved caspases, and condensed nuclei, which could have provided further insights into the sustained nature of NETs activity. The findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive investigation with an expanded sample size, controlled left ventricular mass data, and methodical sampling at regular intervals throughout the study to evaluate this phenomenon more accurately. NETs have also been shown to promote the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in mouse models ( Brill et al., 2012 ). A complication associated with cardiovascular degeneration during space flight that was recently brought to light is the occurrence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). Approximately 2 months into a mission aboard the International Space Station in 2019, a female astronaut noticed an abnormality during an ultrasound examination ( Auñón-Chancellor et al., 2020 ). Upon further examination and consultation with physicians on Earth, the astronaut was diagnosed with a left internal jugular venous thrombosis. The astronaut presented with no signs or symptoms, and she had no family or personal history of venous thromboembolisms. A therapeutic regimen was quickly established for the astronaut and she was luckily treated in a timely manner. This incidence exemplifies the unknown health consequences associated with unique stressors of the space environment. Although there are other confounding factors that may have contributed to the astronaut’s hypercoagulable state, there is evidence that her exposure to space radiation was a primary constituent. We found NETs presentation in the myocardium, but no significant enrichment of inflammatory cytokines was identified in the plasma. Neutrophils serve as the first-line of innate immunity. The cytokines that trigger NETs formation might be detectable during the acute injury stage. Thus, there is a pressing need for another study that collects samples shortly after GCR exposure to accurately determine what triggers NETs. While the exact mechanism behind NET formation following GCR exposure remains elusive in our study and whether NET formation may have played a role in the astronaut’s development of VTE is unknown, we propose a hypothesis involving chronic tissue damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation post-radiation exposure as potential mechanisms, warranting further investigation.",
