    "Abstract": "Abstract Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic ( VEGFA ) and pro-osteogenic gene ( BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN ) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.

    "Results": "Changes in Vascular Morphology in Mouse Calvaria after 15 and 30 days of Spaceflight Our previous µCT analysis on STS-131 S F calvaria show that 15 days of spaceflight results in a 30% increase in bone volume in spaceflight mice calvaria compared to control mice ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). However, 30 days of spaceflight in BION-M1 did not show remarkable differences in bone volume and thickness ( Macaulay et al., 2017 ). To determine the spaceflight associated vascular effects in mice calvaria, we first qualitatively compared the size of the parietal fenestrae of BION-M1 previously occupied by the vessels from the BION-M1 µCT micrographs ( Macaulay et al., 2017 ). The bone thickness and bone volume of BION-M1 mice calvarial sections are published elsewhere ( Macaulay et al., 2017 ). The scanned µCT micrographs of calvarial sections from GC and SF mice showed decreases in the size of fenestrae around the parietal sutures apart from the appearance of increases in cross-sectional thickness in the representative SF group compared to GC group ( Figure 2A , Panels A and B). FIGURE 2.

The blood vessels (BV) and the edge of the bone plates in the GC and SF mice are shown. The arrows are pointing to the size of the fenestrae (C,D) Eosin hematoxylin staining of the frontal section of the parietal region showing two large venules, arteriole, numerous foci, and cell nucleus within the suture surrounded by loose connective tissue (E,F) Isolectin-IB4 staining of the parietal sections of the mice calvaria; labeling of both large and small vessels is shown with a dotted white line (G–J) Measurements of isolectin-IB4-stained blood vessel diameter and capillary number performed on ≥15–20 microscope images per slide section (n = 2 sections/slide) for a total of eight STS-131 mice exposed to 15 days microgravity (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 4) and 10 BION-M1 mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity (GC, n = 5; SF, n = 5). The values are expressed in mm. The data are represented as mean ± SE, * p = 0.02. The images were obtained with a 4x objective lens and depict fenestrae containing calvarial vessels. Scale bar is 2 mm and the width of the section is 2 mm. Further qualitative histological examination of the bone trabeculae along the suture showed a number of foci, nucleus and empty spaces left by dead cells in the suture region and the bone plates ( Figure 2A , Panel C and D). Next, we quantified parasagittal vessel structural and molecular vascular adaptations to 15-day and 30-day spaceflight by immunostaining capillaries in the sagittal suture section of the mice calvaria with, Griffonia simplicifolia lectin isolectin-B4 as a fluorescent endothelial cell marker ( Figure 2A , Panels E and F). Manual, double-blinded quantification of Lectin B4-stained parasagittal vessels of the mice calvaria showed a significant increase in vessel numbers in SF mice compared to GC in the STS- 131 mice cohort (GC: 6 ± 2 vessels/mm 2 , SF: 10 ± 6 vessels/mm 2 ; n = 4, * p = 0.054, t -test and Mann-Whitney u-test) ( Figure 2B ). The vessel diameters in bone trabeculae are reduced 4-fold in SF compared to GC in STS-131 tissues (15–20 images, two sections/slide, * p = 0.02) ( Figure 2A , Panel C). In BION-M1 mice calvaria, there were no significant differences in the diameter or the number of vessels between GC and SF mice (GC: 20 ± 14 vessels/mm 2 , SF: 16 ± 8 vessels/mm 2 ; n = 5, * p > 0.05, t -test and Mann-Whitney u-test) ( Figure 2C ). Capillarization is increased and diameter of the vessel is decreased in the STS-131 S F population while no significant change in the vessel numbers or diameter occurs in BION-M1 SF mice. Microgravity-Associated Alterations in Calvaria Gene Expression Related to Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis To determine the effects of cephalad fluid shifts on calvarial angiogenesis and osteogenesis associated gene expression, VEGFA , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ), BMP-2 , dentin matrix protein 1 ( DMP1 ), RUNX2 and OCN were examined using qPCR in central parietal section of calvaria samples from GC and BION-M1 SF mice. Pro-angiogenic VEGFA expression increases 15 folds in SF compared to GC mice ( Figure 3 , Panel A). Concomitantly, BMP-2 gene expression increases 11 fold in SF compared to GC ( Figure 3 , Panel C). RUNX2 , required for osteoblast differentiation, also increases 2-fold in SF mice compared to GC ( Figure 3 , Panel D). DMP1 is involved in the regulation of bone formation and is upregulated in SF mice ( Figure 3 , Panel F). OCN remained unchanged in GC and SF mice. The material was insufficient to analyze SOST expression, involved in anabolic activity of bone. In sum, both angiogenic and osteogenic genes in the calvaria are upregulated in response to spaceflight-related fluid shifts. FIGURE 3.

Values are expressed as mean ± SE. Significant differences are indicated by ** p < 0.0001 from an unpaired Student’s t-test followed by Mann-Whitney u-test (n = 6 GC and 6 SF animals).",
    "Conclusion": "Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure. Unloaded regions of the body such as calvaria show an 30% increase in bone volume when exposed to spaceflight conditions compared to ground controls ( Zhang et al., 2013 ), suggesting differential regulation of load bearing and unloaded regions of the body. Previous work has shown impaired cerebral perfusion and blood distribution based on structural modifications of vessels in the brain due to head-ward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity ( Sofronova et al., 1985 ; Taylor et al., 2013 ). The mechanosensitivity of bone cells to compressive forces and subsequent increase in bone formation in response to mechanical stimuli is known, calvarial adaptations to cephalad fluid shifts, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebrovascular regulation due to microgravity exposure are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we describe for the first time calvarial vascular morphological alterations in mice exposed to STS-131 conditions, along with angiogenesis and osteogenesis-associated calvarial gene expression changes in mice from BION-M1. Consensus is lacking on the exact effects of microgravity on cerebrovascular regulation as the results from different models are inconsistent. Most of the interpretation of the data is based on patterns derived from other pathologies ( Du et al., 2021 ). Consensus points to fluid redistribution and blood pooling in the brain in the absence of hydrostatic gradients as precipitating the neurological and pathological conditions associated with microgravity. Spaceflight reduces bone mineral density in the lower load-bearing musculoskeletal regions compared to non-load bearing regions such as the skull ( LeBlanc et al., 2000 ; Vico et al., 2000 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ). Mouse skull is a rarely studied structure in spite of its abundance of blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as its structural and functional roles during homeostasis and repair. Calvarial thickness and suture growth is age-dependent and progressive ( Alberius and Johnell, 1990 ). The suture section of the calvarial parietal bone consists of the maximum density of the capillaries which support bone development and is therefore suitable for studying vessel morphology and number. The suture in the calvaria is heavily vascularized with small central vessels ( Alberius and Johnell, 1990 ). Lectin binding to the glycoconjugates of endothelial cells plasmalemma allow for a simple method for the visualization of morphology. Therefore, we used lectin stain to label calvarial blood vessels. Blood vessel diameter is up- or downregulated depending on the intensity and direction of blood flow. Correspondingly, our study demonstrated reductions in calvarial blood vessel diameter in STS-131 S F mice as a response to increase in demands for blood flow and bone volume. Our data showed differential profiles for vessel diameters and numbers in the calvarial sections of mice included on STS-131 (15-day) or BION-M1 (30-day). In STS-131 mice, the vessel diameter was reduced and capillarization increased, a trend suggesting calvarial vessel remodeling and capillarization in the bone trabeculae concomitant to increase in calvarial bone mass identified in early study ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated a causal link between expression of angiogenic markers and bone formation ( Cackowski et al., 2010 ; Moser et al., 2018 ). During injury or stress, resident suture stem cells secrete VEGF and recruit blood vessels to facilitate repair; VEGF stimulates the proliferation of osteoblast and increased VEGF levels are observed at the proliferative stage of bone repair, and this vascularization is essential for tissue recovery and repair. Insufficient or incongruous formation of bone blood vessels leads to irregular bone formation and increased risk of bone fractures ( Stegen et al., 2015 ). The regeneration of vascular supply through vascularization in parallel with osteogenesis is central in the formation of the new functional bone ( Amini et al., 2012 ). Alterations in VEGFA expression correlates with the number of vessels in spaceflight calvaria in the STS-131 flight mice ( Figure 2B ). Local application of exogenous recombinant BMP2 completely regenerates calvarial defects in a rodent model and is important in tissue healing and restoration. In humans, BMP2 recombinant protein can regenerate mandibular continuity and cleft palate defects ( Boyne, 2001 ; Dickinson et al., 2008 ; Herford and Boyne, 2008 ). BMP-2 addition dramatically increases Osteocalcin (OCN) which in turn is responsible for the pro-osteogenesis function of BMP2. BMP2 induces osteoblast differentiation through RUNX2 expression which directly regulates osteocalcin expression to increase bone formation. RUNX2 is a global regulator of osteogenesis and is crucial for regulating the expression of bone-specific genes. Autocrine BMP production is necessary for the Runx2 transcription factor to be active. Runx2 executes and completes BMP2 signaling for osteoblast differentiation. The co-ordinated activity of Runx2 and BMP2 activated SMADS are critical in bone remodeling and skeleton formation. Taken together, endogenous BMP signaling enhances bone formation and regulation of BMP activity in the postnatal stages is critical for normal bone formation. While acknowledging that there may be site specific and bone dependent differences described by others ( Quarto et al., 2010 ; Kwan et al., 2011 ; Niziolek et al., 2011 ), we show that the parietal region of the mice calvaria are sensitive to fluctuations in fluid shifts and results bone vascular responses. Microgravity-mediated cephalad fluid shift results in high intracranial pressure which may affect vessel morphology. Cerebral vasomotor and mechanical properties, deficiencies in femoral muscle regeneration and defective immune response occurs after 30 days of BION-M1 spaceflight ( Sofronova et al., 1985 ; Andreev-Andrievskiy et al., 2014 ; Markina et al., 2018 ; Radugina et al., 2018 ; Tascher et al., 2019 ). Contrary to this finding, our µCT data of the BION-M1 mice suggests that the calvarial bone structure remain unchanged. However the gene expression of sclerostin, a potent inhibitor of bone formation, is higher in the spaceflight group based on our previous results ( Macaulay et al., 2017 ) implying the possibility of both anabolic and catabolic activity of sclerostin. This is in contrast to previous reports that show that loss of sclerostin increases cranial bone growth and regeneration and sclerostin antibodies are used to increase bone mass in clinical trials of osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta ( Kang et al., 2018 ; Scheiber et al., 2019 ) suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in bone formation. One of the mechanisms of bone regeneration is the recruitment of stromal and hematopoietic precursors from the bone marrow ( Markina et al., 2018 ). The proliferative capacity of the bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic precursors decreases in the BION-M1 mouse population cohort of mice ( Markina et al., 2018 ) which may explain our findings that the vessel diameter and number of vessels are unchanged in BION-M1 compared to STS-131 ( Figure 2 ). The molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological adaptations of calvarial vessels and bone to cephalad fluid shifts remain poorly understood.",
