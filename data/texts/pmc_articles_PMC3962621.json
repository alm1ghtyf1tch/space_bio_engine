    "Abstract": "Abstract Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch fibers. An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOSμ immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOSμ protein content in the cytosol increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.

    "Results": "Alterations in soleus muscle morphology with 54 h of mechanical unloading are regulated by oxidative stress. In the first experiment, we tested the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species were a causal factor in the unloading-induced phenotype: reduction of muscle fiber cross-sectional and partial shift of fiber type from slow-to-fast twitch. Previously, nitric oxide synthase inhibition was shown to regulate muscle hypertrophy and fiber-type shift in response to overloading ( 15 , 38 ). In addition, inhibition or genetic ablation of nNOS substantially reduced proteolysis and muscle fiber atrophy during mechanical unloading ( 42 ). nNOSμ may, indeed, be responsible for guiding skeletal muscle remodeling in response to a dynamic change in mechanical loading ( 42 ). Body masses (means ± SD) were not statistically different among ambulatory control (435.1 ± 17.6 g), hindlimb unloaded (437.4 ± 22.4g), and hindlimb unloaded + EUK-134 (415.8 ± 22.5 g). While the EUK-134 trended lower, their mass also trended lower prior to the commencement of the study. Soleus-to-body mass ratio trended lower for HU (158.6 ± 11.4 mg/kg) than CON (165.5 ± 15.6 mg/kg) or HU+EUK (163.8 ± 9.27 mg/kg) but did not reach statistical significance. Total protein concentration was significantly lower in HU (1,160 ± 126 μg/g) than CON (1,649 ± 90 μg/g), suggestive of greater water and/or reduced protein levels during the early phase of mechanical unloading. However, HU + EUK total protein content (1,302 ± 175 μg/g) was not significantly lower than that of controls. We quantified muscle CSA and observed that the fiber cross-sectional area profile ( Fig. 1 A ) for the soleus exposed to hindlimb unloading shifted to the left, illustrating a marked reduction in muscle fiber cross-sectional area ( Fig. 1 B ). The greatest number of soleus fibers was found in the 1,800–2,400 μm 2 range after unloading, in contrast with the 3,000–3,600 μm 2 range in the ambulatory control group. Remarkably, muscle fiber atrophy was virtually completely abolished by EUK-134 ( Fig. 1 A ). Interestingly, we found that EUK-134 reduced muscle fiber atrophy primarily in Type I fibers ( Fig. 1 , A and B ) but offered no protection in Type IIa and Type IIb/d fibers ( Fig. 1 , C and D ). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab Oxidative stress elicits muscle fiber atrophy with mechanical unloading. Fifty-four hours of hindlimb unloading reduced muscle fiber size as displayed by fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) distribution ( A ) for CON, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and HU-EUK rats ( n = 8/group). EUK-134 protected against the left shift in muscle fiber CSA distribution, indicating that oxidative stress was causal in fiber atrophy in the early phase of unloading. Muscle fiber atrophy was apparent in slow-twitch of Type I fibers of the soleus ( B ) ( P < 0.01), but not in Type IIa fibers ( C ) or Type IIb/d fibers ( D ) of the soleus. a,b Letters that differ are significantly different from each other ( P < 0.05). To determine whether EUK-134 affected muscle mass and fiber cross-sectional area, independent of unloading, we conducted a set of follow-up control experiments. We tested 10 additional rats under loaded, ambulatory conditions, in which rats received three saline or EUK-134 injections over a 78-h period. This strategy covered the 54-h unloading period plus the injection, given 24 h prior to HU. Body weights, soleus mass ( Fig. 2 A ), and the ratio of muscle mass to body mass ( Fig. 2 B ) were not different between the saline and EUK-134 groups. In addition, means for skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area ( Fig. 2 C ) did not significantly differ between saline and EUK-134-injected rats when loaded with normal ambulation. These data are consistent with the notion that EUK-134's effects on skeletal muscle mass were specific to the unloading protocol. Fig. 2. Open in a new tab EUK-134 has no effect on soleus mass or fiber cross-sectional area in ambulatory rats. Seventy-eight hours EUK-134 or saline injection had no differential effect on soleus muscle mass ( A ), soleus mass/body mass ratio ( B ), or soleus muscle cross-sectional area ( C ). We tested the hypothesis that unloading-induced shift of skeletal muscle fiber-type from slow to fast was dependent on oxidative stress. Representative ATPase stains with acid and alkaline preincubation that are labile for Type II and Type I fibers, respectively, are displayed in Fig. 3 A . Mechanical unloading caused a significant reduction in the percentage of Type I fibers, as expected ( Fig. 3 B ). In addition, hindlimb unloading also caused an elevation in the percentage of Type IIa- ( Fig. 3 C ) and Type IIb/d ( Fig. 3 D )-positive fibers. Remarkably, EUK-134 virtually halted the unloading-induced reduction in slow-twitch or Type I fibers within the rat soleus ( Fig. 3 , A and B ). Consistent with the effect on Type I fibers, EUK-134 also prevented elevation of fast-twitch Type IIa ( Fig. 3 C ) and Type IIb/d fibers observed with unloading ( Fig. 3 D ). To our knowledge, these are the first data to indicate that redox signaling plays a significant role in the fiber-type shift that occurs in response to mechanical unloading. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Unloading-induced fiber-type shift is redox regulated in CON, HU, and HU-EUK rats ( n = 8/group). A modified ATPase-staining technique revealed that significant shift in muscle soleus muscle fiber-type from fast to slow in the soleus as a result of HU. A : representative sections for both alkaline (pH = 10.4) and acidic (pH = 4.25) preincubations are presented. A reduction of slow-twitch fibers (Type I) was noted with HU ( B ) ( P < 0.05), accompanied by an elevation in Type IIa ( C ), and Type IIb/d fibers ( D ). EUK-134 abrogated the unloading-induced fiber-type shift ( A–D ). a,b Letters that differ are significantly different from each other ( P < 0.05). EUK-134 attenuates nNOS translocation with hindlimb unloading. In the next set of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that perturbations in the location of nNOSμ would be reduced by EUK-134. Hematoxylin-and-eosin stains are presented in Fig. 4 A . Using immunohistochemistry, we initially observed substantial delocalization of nNOS from the sarcolemma as a result of short-term hindlimb unloading ( Fig. 4 , B and C ). Suzuki et al. ( 42 ) had previously reported that nNOS leaves the sarcolemma and is dispersed through the sarcoplasm after 14 days of hindlimb unloading. Figure 4 B features IHCs for nNOS without tyramide signaling amplification (TSA), and Fig. 1 C with TSA. Utilizing both methods, we found that localization of nNOS at the sarcolemma was dramatically reduced in the soleus by 54 h of hindlimb unloading. However, cytosolic nNOS localization ( 29 ) was more readily observed with TSA with the greatest positive staining in the sarcoplasm within the HU + saline group. Remarkably, 3 days of injections with EUK-134 virtually prevented the loss of nNOS-positive staining from the sarcolemmal region in Fischer-344 rats ( Fig. 4 , B and C ). Indeed, there was robust positive staining of nNOS on the soleus muscle fiber periphery in the EUK-treated group, similar to ambulatory control rats injected with saline. Thus, we provide the first evidence that dislocation of nNOSμ may occur in less than 3 days of mechanical unloading in the rat soleus muscle. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab EUK-134 reduces dislocation of nNOSμ from the sarcolemma of the soleus from HU Fischer-344 rats. Hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained muscle cross sections are visualized in Fig. 4 ( left ) for control (CON), HU ( middle ), and HU + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) ( n = 6/group; right ). Immunolocalization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the sarcolemma was lost in the rat soleus muscle as a result of HU, an effect abrogated by the catalytic SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 as visualized without tyramide signaling amplification (TSA) ( B ) and with TSA ( C ). Protein immunoblotting for nNOS was analyzed from membrane ( D ) and cytosolic ( E ) fractions. nNOS protein abundance per expression of dystrophin decreased with HU and was protected by EUK-134. EUK-134 attenuated HU-induced elevation in the cytosolic fraction. a Significantly different ( P < 0.01) than the CON group. b Significantly different ( P < 0.01) than the HU group. Scale bar = 100 μm. nNOS protein abundance measured via immunoblot paralled our IHC findings. nNOS levels in the membrane fraction levels, when equated for dystrophin, significantly decreased in the hindlimb unloading group when compared with ambulatory controls ( Fig. 4 , D and E ). Treatment with EUK-134 prevented the reduction in membrane nNOS levels observed with HU, consistent with localization results visualized in Fig. 4 , B and C . In contrast, nNOS protein abundance in soluble, cytosolic fraction, equated per GAPDH levels, increased significantly in the HU group ( Fig. 4 B ). Remarkably, EUK-134 prevented the unloading-induced increase in cytosolic nNOS protein abundance. Our immunohistological and protein localization data, therefore, clearly demonstrate that nNOSμ is, indeed, translocated away from the sarcolemma within the first 54 h of mechanical unloading. Furthermore, translocation of nNOSμ with mechanical unloading appeared to be redox-signaling dependent. EUK-134 protects against unloading-related reduction in FoxO3a phosphorylation (Thr-32). Important regulators of muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading include FoxO3a via dephosphorylation and NF-κB via phosphorylation of its inhibitor regulator IκB (IκB) ( 35 ). Suzuki et al. ( 42 ) demonstrated that dephosphorylation and activation of FoxO3a was dependent upon nNOS translocation from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. Given that EUK-134 attenuated nNOS translocation with 54 h of HU, we tested the hypothesis that EUK-134 would also attenuate loss of phosphorylation at Thr-32 for FoxO3a. Levels of FoxO3a phosphorylation (Thr-32) significantly decreased with the short-term unloading protocol ( Fig. 5 ), as expected. EUK-134 treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation levels at Thr-32 for FoxO3a during HU that were significantly greater than the soleus of unloaded rats injected with saline. In addition, FoxO3a phosphorylation was not significantly different in the HU group injected with EUK-134. Fig. 5. Open in a new tab Effect of EUK-134 on FoxO3a phosphorylation. Effect of EUK-134 on FoxO3a phosphorylation at Thr-32 in the soleus of rats that were hindlimb-unloaded for 54 h in CON, HU, and HU-EUK rats ( n = 6/group). a Significantly different than the CON group ( P < 0.01). b Significantly different than the HU group ( P < 0.05). Unloading-induced elevation of oxidative stress and Nox2 is reduced by EUK-134. To determine whether EUK-134, indeed, ameliorated unloading-induced oxidative stress in the soleus muscle, we tracked 4-HNE-positive imaging. Previously, elevation of oxidative stress in response to mechanical unloading has been reported in both hindlimb unloading and mechanical ventilation models ( 23 , 24 , 26 ). In the current study, we found that 4-HNE protein adducts increased in the soleus following 54 h of hindlimb unloading ( Fig. 6 A ). Interestingly, there was increased localization of 4-HNE around the sarcolemma with short-term unloading, using laminin immunofluorescence in parallel images to confirm localization ( Fig. 6 B ). Furthermore, elevation in soleus 4-HNE fluorescence caused by hindlimb unloading was partially abrogated by EUK-134 treatment ( Fig. 6 A ), confirming the inhibitory effect of EUK-134 on oxidative stress. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab EUK-134 reduces 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the HU soleus. We demonstrated that oxidative stress ( A ) was increased by hindlimb unloading using 4-hydroxynonenal as a marker. Highest positive staining occurred near the sarcolemma as localized via immunofluorescence with laminin ( B ) used as a control for identifying muscle cells. Quantification of 4-HNE fluorescence intensity can be found in Fig. 6 C . a Significantly different than the CON group ( P < 0.001). b Significantly different than the HU group ( P < 0.01). We also measured NF-κB using an ELISA technique previously outlined ( 22 ). However, we saw no effects of HU or EUK-134 (data not shown), suggesting the importance of NF-κB likely increases as unloading duration increases. Given the potential for high oxidative stress in the sarcolemmal microenvironment ( 14 ) during mechanical unloading, 4-HNE oxidation, and upregulation of Nox2 noted in DMD ( 46 ), we also determined immunolocalization of two Nox2 subunits: gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox. Short-term hindlimb unloading, indeed, elevated immunostaining intensity at the sarcolemma of the p47phox-positive in the soleus of F344 rats ( Fig. 7 , B and D ). The EUK-134 group displayed lower gp91phox-positive sarcolemmal localization, while p47phox sarcolemmal intensity levels in the EUK-134 group were not significantly different than controls ( Fig. 7 , A–C ). Membrane-positive staining for gp91phox was demonstrated using immunofluorescence against β-sarcoglycan as our membrane proteins. gp91phox, β-sarcoglycan, merged images, and negative control are pictured in Fig. 8 . We also determined p47phox protein abundance using Western immunoblot analysis ( Fig. 9 ). p47phox levels were significantly upregulated in both HU groups. Combined with our DHE data, this is, to our knowledge, the first evidence that the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase in skeletal muscle is elevated in the first 3 days of mechanical unloading. Fig. 7. Open in a new tab Effect of EUK-134 on Nox2 subunit localization at the sarcolemma in for CON, HU, and HU-EUK groups ( n = 6/group). Localization of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits gp91 phox (Nox2) ( A ) and p47 phox ( B ) increased in response to mechanical unloading. The HU-EUK-134 displayed significantly lower ( P < 0.05) levels of gp91 phox ( A , C ) than the HU group. p47 phox -positive immunostaining ( B and D ) was significantly greater ( P < 0.05) for HU vs. CON, but not for rats treated with EUK-134. Scale bar = 100 μm. Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Immunofluorescence of gp91phox in soleus muscles from control (CON) and hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. β-sarcoglycan is used as a sarcolemmal marker. Merged images are also displayed. Rabbit IgG is used as a negative control for the primary antibody. Fig. 9. Open in a new tab Protein abundance for p47phox, expressed as a ratio relative to GAPDH ( top ) and β-actin expression ( bottom ). Representative blots and summary statistics are presented in HU and HU + EUK-134 groups exhibited significantly greater p47phox than controls (CON). Both GAPDH and β-actin were tested as loading controls. Neither GAPDH nor β-actin exhibited any mean differences in protein abundance ( Fig. 10 ).",
    "Conclusion": "In this study, EUK-134, a mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, attenuated the mechanical unloading or “spaceflight phenotype” in skeletal muscle in the hindlimb-unloading ground model: muscle fiber atrophy and slow-twitch to fast-twitch fiber-type shift. EUK-134 protection of unloading-induced muscle atrophy was linked to abrogation of nNOS translocation away from the sarcolemma. Furthermore, EUK-134 also prevented dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32, previously shown to be regulated by nNOS translocation. EUK-134 reduced oxidative stress and upregulation of Nox2. A discussion of the principle finding follows. EUK-134 attenuation of nNOS translocation and morphological changes. Our data indicate that unloading-induced translocation of nNOSμ away from the sarcolemma is part of an early adaptation to alterations in mechanotransduction during the unloading process. Moreover, given that EUK-134 mitigated unloading-related upregulation of oxidative stress, we propose nNOSμ translocation in response to mechanical unloading in skeletal muscle is a redox-dependent phenomenon. nNOSμ translocation has previously been associated with increased FoxO3a activation and MuRF-1 activation and muscle atrophy during ground hindlimb unloading ( 42 ) and during 91 days of spaceflight ( 33 ). In contrast, a new publication indicates that nNOS is necessary in triggering an anabolic signaling pathway involving Nox4 and mTOR, which responds to overloading and regulates muscle hypertrophy ( 15 ). Furthermore, nitric oxide and NF-κB were also found to be essential for stretch-induced proliferation of myoblasts ( 40 ). Indeed, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase has been shown to attenuate muscle remodeling and fiber-type shift in response to altered mechanical loading, whether the magnitude be increased or decreased ( 15 , 38 , 42 ). Therefore, redox signaling may couple with nNOS to regulate remodeling of skeletal muscle morphology in response to dynamic changes in loading. In contrast, nitric oxide appears not to be requisite for basal proliferation of myoblasts and development ( 1 , 39 ). Intervention with EUK-134 not only mitigated unloading-induced atrophy, but also appeared to arrest a shift away from the slow-twitch phenotype in the rat soleus. This was an unexpected finding, but potentially significant, in understanding regulation of slow- and fast-twitch fibers in response to use and disuse. For example, Smith et al. ( 38 ) reported that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase abrogated a fiber-type shift from fast to slow in the plantaris with increased loading as a result of ablation of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, as they are all plantar flexor muscles. Therefore, we postulate that nNOS translocation may contribute to a shift in fiber type from slow to fast. We did note that EUK-134 protection against muscle fiber atrophy was confined to Type I fibers. These findings could be consistent with preferential response of Type I fibers by mechanical unloading or an unloading-induced shift in muscle fiber type from slow-twitch fibers, which are paradoxically larger in the soleus ( Fig. 1 ). It is possible that the time course of the study (54 h) may be too short to elicit morphological alterations in Type II fibers. In addition, the shift from slow- to fast-twitch fibers may seek to preserve cross-sectional area. Thus, additional study is warranted. EUK-134 protection of FoxO3a phosphorylation. EUK-134 ameliorated the reduction in phosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32 caused by hindlimb unloading ( Fig. 5 ), thus reducing a trigger of proteolysis and fiber atrophy ( 9 ). Previously, Suzuki et al. ( 42 ) demonstrated that translocation of nNOS and cytosolic nitric oxide release by nNOS were required to dephosphorylate FoxO3a in the rat soleus during 14 days of mechanical unloading. FoxO3a activation stimulates upregulation of the ubiquitin ligases MuRF-1 and atrogin-1 ( 42 ). Therefore, protection against FoxO3a dephosphorylation at Thr-32 by EUK-134 is consistent with a pathway, whereby oxidative stress participates in translocation of nNOS with mechanical unloading, directly leading to FoxO3a activation, as well as increased proteolysis through ubiquitin ligases (e.g., MuRF-1), leading to fiber atrophy ( 42 ). Oxidative stress and mechanical unloading. Our results are consistent with the hypotheses that oxidative stress 1 ) is elevated early during mechanical unloading in skeletal muscle and 2 ) contributes significantly to the atrophy as a consequence of unloading. Protective effects of EUK-134 were specific to changes caused during the unloading protocol, as EUK-134 injections had no effect on normally loaded skeletal muscle mass or morphology ( Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, elevated oxidative stress, as detected with 4-hydroxynonenal, was attenuated with EUK-134, which corresponded with sparing of muscle fiber atrophy. Elevation of oxidative stress after 54 h of mechanical unloading of the rat soleus is consistent with previous studies that indicate oxidative stress is elevated during the first few days of mechanical unloading. Localization of 4-HNE adducts near the sarcolemma ( Fig. 6 ) suggests a source nearby (e.g., Nox2, subsarcolemmal mitochondria). Previously, Abrogast et al. ( 4 ) reported that oxidative stress was elevated in unloaded skeletal muscle after 1–3 days. Bowman-Birk inhibitor complex (BBIC), which exhibits antiproteasome and antioxidant properties, significantly reduced unloading-induced fiber atrophy and reduction of force-generating capacity ( 4 ). In addition, Powers and colleagues ( 48 ) also demonstrated that elevation in oxidative stress occurs in just 12–24 h of unloading in the diaphragm muscle during mechanical ventilation. In a series of studies, oxidative stress was found to be causal in stimulating apoptosis and muscle fiber atrophy in the unloaded diaphragm muscle ( 25 , 26 , 34 , 48 ). Recently, transfection of catalase in the soleus has been shown to reduce soleus muscle atrophy during leg immobilization, while lowering oxidative stress ( 9 ). It should be noted that evidence supportive of a contribution of oxidative stress in eliciting muscle atrophy with unloading has not been consistent across studies. Indeed, while some antioxidant strategies have been successful in reducing skeletal muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading ( 4 , 25 , 30 ), other interventions have not ( 6 , 20 ). For example, administration of BBIC significantly attenuated muscle atrophy in limb muscles ( 4 ), while Trolox was less successful ( 6 ). Vitamin E reduced unloading-induced atrophy when preinjected for 21 days ( 3 ), while a broad, nonspecific cocktail of antioxidants was ineffective ( 20 ). However, more recent, mechanistic studies indicate that ROS play an important role in unloading-induced atrophy. For example, catalase transfection suppressed activation of FoxO3a and NF-κB, while attenuating one-half of the soleus mass loss during 7 days of unloading ( 9 ). Inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative stress using SS-31 also significantly ameliorated muscle atrophy in a casting model of mechanical unloading ( 27 ). The reasons underlying differential responses to antioxidant strategies have not been resolved, but length of time, localized effects, specificity, and catalytic vs. scavenger approaches could all play a role. It is also possible that antioxidant therapeutics may be more effective in the early phase of mechanical unloading (1–7 days) than in later phases (14+ days). While redox regulation of subsarcolemmal proteins, including nNOS in skeletal muscle remains poorly understood, there is growing acceptance that ROS sources participate in subcellular regulation of microenvironments, including Nox2 signaling in caveolae and lipid rafts ( 18 , 44 ). We found increased Nox2 subunit localization at the membrane ( Fig. 4 ) and elevated protein abundance of p47phox ( Fig. 9 ); however, we cannot conclude a causal relationship. In addition, it is possible that Nox2 could serve to amplify or augment mitochondrial ROS ( 27 ), recently established as a causal factor in disuse-related atrophy. Study limitations. Recent studies have suggested that the cytokine TNF-α may play a significant role in apoptosis and ubiquitin ligase activation in skeletal muscle during mechanical unloading ( 2 ). It is possible that EUK-134 might play a protective role in unloading-induced atrophy by suppressing TNF-α levels, possibly via NF-κB. However, we found no change in NF-κB activity with unloading or EUK-134 at this stage of mechanical unloading. It is possible that under high levels (mM) of H 2 O 2 EUK-134 may oxidize to oxo-EUK and quench nitric oxide (·NO) ( 37 ). While H 2 O 2 levels in skeletal muscle are believed to exist in the high-nM to low-μM range, future experiments could specifically inhibit iNOS as a source of RNS. In addition, high levels of EUK-134 at the tissue level may also remove or prevent the production of peroxynitrite (OONO − ). Thus, it is possible that nNOS may contribute to its own dislocation. It is also possible that mechanical unloading affects nNOS via transcriptional regulation rather than posttranslational mechanisms or interaction with other proteins (e.g., caveolin-3). These provocative questions should be foci of future investigations. In summary, translocation of nNOSμ during short-term mechanical unloading in the rat soleus was reduced by the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 and linked to protection against muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shift from slow to fast. In addition, prevention of nNOS translocation by EUK-134 was directly associated with protection against dephosphorylation of FoxO3a. Finally, EUK-134 reduced oxidative stress and normalized Nox2 levels. Our results suggest that loss of nNOSμ from the sarcolemma is an early, redox-dependent event in the response to mechanical unloading, linked to morphological changes in skeletal muscle phenotype.",
