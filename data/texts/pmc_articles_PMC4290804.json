    "Abstract": "Abstract Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

    "Results": "3.1. Protein recovery and identification in spaceflight material RNAlater is widely used as an RNA preservative, primarily because it is a strong protein denaturant. Proteins can be recovered from RNAlater-preserved materials (van Eijsden et al. , 2013 ), but because the tissues and proteins are denatured, the biological properties of the subcellular components or proteins were not used to pre-separate proteins into classes such as soluble, cytoplasmic, membrane, or cell wall proteins. Therefore, the proteins identified in this study are simply considered soluble proteins according to the protocol used for their extraction. Sufficient protein was recovered from each sample to proceed with iTRAQ methods. Over 1500 proteins were identified in the root and leaf samples at a global FDR of 5% against the decoy database, and over 1300 proteins in each sample at an FDR of 1% (see Supplementary Fig. S2 ). An FDR of 5% was chosen as the cutoff for further analysis of proteins in this study. Of the 1570 proteins identified in the samples at 5% FDR, 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins were identified with three or more protein-unique peptides, thus allowing them to be accurately quantified across the various flight and ground control samples ( Fig. 2 ). FIG. 2. Open in a new tab The number of proteins in the leaf and root samples meeting all the criteria for quantitation by iTRAQ. (Color graphics available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast ) 3.2. Differential protein abundance in spaceflight A Fisher's test of combined probabilities was used to determine differences in quantitation values for each protein identified with three or more unique peptides. The Fisher's test accounted for the number of peptides identified in each sample, together with the biological replicates of the root samples, to produce a p value for comparison of spaceflight versus ground controls for leaves and roots. Volcano plots of the p values and differential abundance as fold change of the root and leaf samples are presented in Fig. 3 . Currently, an iTRAQ method underestimates fold changes, implying small changes may indicate significant differences between samples (Bantscheff et al. , 2008 ; DeSouza et al. , 2009 ; Karp et al. , 2010 ); thus, most iTRAQ studies use fold changes of <0.8 or >1.2. Therefore, proteins were considered differentially abundant with p values greater than the threshold value (α=0.05) and fold-change values in excess of 0.8 and 1.2. Figure 4 shows Venn diagrams of the number of proteins differing in abundance between spaceflight and ground control samples. Of the 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins that were able to be accurately quantified, 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins met the criteria of statistical significance by p value and differential abundance by fold change in the spaceflight samples. Only 41 of the significant differentially abundant proteins were shared between roots and leaves ( Fig. 4 ). FIG. 3.

Negative log10 p values were plotted on the y axis with log2 normalized fold change expression levels on the x axis. Significant differential expression with p value threshold values α=0.05 were present in areas exceeding the 0.8 and 1.2 of fold change threshold values.

Open in a new tab Summary of the differential protein accumulation in spaceflight samples compared to ground control. Overall, 358 root and 256 shoot proteins were differentially represented in the spaceflight sample. When parsed by whether the protein was increased or decreased in spaceflight, 237 root proteins and 200 shoot proteins were up-regulated and accumulated to more abundance in spaceflight, while 121 root proteins and 56 shoot proteins were down-regulated in spaceflight. (Color graphics available online at www.liebertonline.com/ast ) In roots, 237 proteins were up-regulated in spaceflight, with an increase in abundance in the spaceflight samples meeting the significance criteria. In those same root samples, 121 proteins were found to be down-regulated and less abundant in spaceflight. For leaves, 200 proteins were more abundant in spaceflight, while 56 were less abundant. Again, few of these differentially regulated proteins were shared between the root and leaf samples. Only 47 proteins were similarly differentially abundant in both roots and leaves in spaceflight, being similarly increased or decreased in both tissues ( Fig. 5 ). There were 21 proteins that were shared between roots and leaves but increased in one tissue and decreased in the other. A summary Venn diagram and table is presented at the bottom of Fig. 4 .

Table 1 is available in color online at www.liebertonline.com/ast . 3.3. Functional analysis of proteins differentially abundant in spaceflight When the proteomic changes were highlighted in global metabolic pathways ( http://pmn.plantcyc.org/overviewsWeb/celOv.shtml?orgid=ARA ), the effects of spaceflight were obviously different between leaf and root tissues ( Supplementary Fig. S3 and also referring elements of Table 1 ). In addition, PAGE showed quite distinct patterns between leaves and roots when comparing the differential abundance based on the functional classification of the proteins ( Table 2 ). For example, responses to light stimulus and response to radiation were similar, as were pathways involving cell wall metabolism ( Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table 2 ). Interestingly, in leaves, categories of proteins related to several biological pathways were up-regulated, including stress and defense responses, photosynthesis, translation, gene expression, and cellular component biogenesis, while categories of proteins involved in the functional generation of precursor metabolites and energy, localization, and transport were repressed. In addition, categories of proteins related to specific molecular functions, such as carbohydrate binding, structural constituent of ribosome, and isomerase activity, were up-regulated in response to spaceflight in leaves. However, categories associated with cell structure exhibited abundance in leaves and scarcity in roots. In roots, protein categories associated with several biological processes, such as cofactor metabolism, oxidative stress responses, and cellular lipid metabolism, showed increased abundance. The abundance of protein categories associated with basic molecular functions, such as ATP binding, adenyl ribonucleotide binding, adenyl nucleotide binding, purine nucleoside binding, and nucleoside binding, were also enhanced in roots.

Comparison of proteomic and gene expression data The proteomics data presented here were derived from Arabidopsis grown in Run 1B of the TAGES series of plant growth experiments. Gene expression from microarray data are available from Run 3A of the TAGES experiments (Paul et al. , 2013 ), which involved similar-aged plants grown under very similar conditions on the ISS. The 546 differentially expressed proteins of the present study were compared to the 480 genes exhibiting differential transcript levels in the previous study. The genes encoding most of the proteins quantified in this study did not show a differential mRNA expression, and many of the proteins for genes differentially regulated at the mRNA level were not identified in this proteomics survey. A total of 34 genes exhibited differential expression at both transcript and protein levels. Their transcript and protein fold-change values are compared in Fig. 5 . Among the genes and proteins that do show differential expression, there is a positive correlation between direction and degree of differential expression ( r =0.4901177, p value=0.0003028; r s =0.5087163, p value=0.0001618). To examine the degree of concordance between transcript and protein expression levels, correlation tests for which Pearson's r and Spearman's rho ( r s ) were used were conducted for a direct comparison of proteins and their corresponding transcript expression levels of 34 genes by using log 2 -fold change between ground and flight tissues. As shown in Fig. 5 , there is a positive correlation in direction and degree of differential expression between transcript and protein expression ( r =0.4901177, p value=0.0003028; r s =0.5087163, p value=0.0001618). 3.5. Cell wall metabolism interaction network An interaction network was constructed to investigate potential functional relationships among the spaceflight differential proteins that are potentially involved in cell wall interactions and metabolisms. Figure 6 shows the results of the interaction analysis with several key collections of proteins highlighted. Physical interactions, shared protein domains, and co-localizations draw nearly all the cell wall–identified proteins of this study into a codified network that links cell wall carbohydrate enzymology with cell-cell interactions and signaling. FIG. 6. Open in a new tab Interaction network of cell wall–related proteins differentially abundant in spaceflight.

Smaller gray circles indicate proteins brought into the network by the software to provide additional connection resolution. Physical interactions are indicated by red connector lines. Shared physical location is indicated by blue connector lines. Shared protein domains are indicated by beige connector lines.

    "Conclusion": "The technical goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using RNAlater-preserved plant tissue, harvested and frozen on orbit, for broad-scale proteomics analysis of Arabidopsis spaceflight responses. RNAlater preservation of Arabidopsis within KFTs on orbit is commonly practiced, and a facile process pathway exists for harvesting to RNAlater and frozen sample return from the ISS. RNAlater-preserved plant materials from the ISS have been extensively used for gene expression analyses; however, to date, the use of RNAlater-preserved ISS material for proteomics has been limited to yeast (van Eijsden et al. , 2013 ). The ability to conduct proteomics analyses on the same samples or on parallel samples returning from this established process pathway would advance the analysis potential for understanding Arabidopsis responses to spaceflight. This study demonstrated that sufficient protein amounts can be isolated from ISS samples preserved in RNAlater to allow broad-scale proteomics studies. Basically, enough protein was recovered from roots and leaves of 12-day-old plants from half a 10 cm 2 Petri plate to conduct proteomic analyses rich enough to return the identities of 1570 proteins and to conduct quantitation on 1432 proteins with iTRAQ methods and relying on at least three unique peptides per protein. Moreover, the methods are sufficiently robust that true biological replicates are consistent and can support statistical methods for evaluation of quantitative differences among sample treatments. These RNAlater iTRAQ methods join frozen native sample recovery and non-isotopic methods (Mazars et al. , 2014 ) as methods that have had successful initial application to space proteomics analyses of plants. It is very likely that the rapid advances in MS currently occurring will raise the number of proteins that can be quantitated in similar future studies that use this or any other sample recovery strategy. And as orbital preservation methods mature and are more broadly applied, informative comparative analyses among various species, growth conditions, and experiment protocols on orbit will become increasingly effective. The proteomic data from this study of three combined Arabidopsis lines support the general notion that plants engage specific metabolic responses to accomplish physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but that response is different among organs (Paul et al. , 2013 ). The primary data supporting this conclusion are shown in Figs. 2 and 4 . Of 885 proteins commonly quantified in roots and leaves, only 47 were similarly regulated in the spaceflight leaf and root samples. In contrast, 290 and 288 proteins in roots and leaves were uniquely differentially regulated by spaceflight in either one organ or the other. Moreover, pathway and process analysis of these differentially accumulated proteins indicates that roots and leaves are altering different pathways in response to spaceflight. There appears, broadly speaking, to be no single response at the proteomic level that is employed by all tissues of the plant in order to adapt to spaceflight. There are, however, a few common threads among the data sets. These data complement results of Mazars et al. ( 2014 ), who used a non-isotopic proteomics approach to examine spaceflight microgravity effects on membrane proteins of whole Arabidopsis seedlings. Their study used seedlings that were grown within chambers in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 12 days on the ISS, with the entire chambers frozen on orbit to allow recovery of frozen seedlings after return to Earth. Microsomal fractions were prepared from the whole seedlings and subjected to a label-free MS analysis. Thus, their analysis used different tissues, different preservation on orbit, different sample preparation that focused on microsomes, and different MS methods. Mazars and colleagues found that 69 microsomal proteins were specifically more abundant in microgravity (compared to ground and 1 g controls), while 80 microsomal proteins were less abundant in microgravity. By using strictly TAIR AGI accession number as the link between their data and the data presented here, there are 23 proteins identified in common between the two studies. More generally, Mazars et al. ( 2014 ) concluded that proteins involved in signaling, trafficking, auxin metabolism, stress, and cell wall metabolism are influenced by microgravity, a conclusion that is supported and extended by the study presented here, with auxin signaling and cell wall remodeling being similarly identified here as altered by spaceflight. Many of the proteins identified here as differentially abundant in spaceflight are associated with auxin metabolism, and a large number are associated with cell wall modification that makes sense in light of the morphologies demonstrated by spaceflight roots (Millar et al. , 2011 ; Paul et al. , 2013 ; Nakashima et al. , 2014 ). Of the differentially represented proteins presented in Table 1 , 95 are associated with cell walls or cell wall metabolism either by Gene Ontology annotation or by reference when using SUBA3 searches (Tanz et al. , 2013 ). The interaction network in Fig. 6 shows that most of these cell wall–associated proteins can be considered within a framework of functionally interactive proteins engaged in cell wall activities. There are many enzymes, such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylases, involved in cell wall carbohydrate modification, deconstruction, and remodeling present in the heart of the network (dark gray highlight in Fig. 6 ) ( e.g. , Gilbert 2010 ). The well-represented FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactans (medium gray highlight in Fig. 6 ) ( e.g. , Seifert et al. , 2014 ) and a SKU5-like protein are involved in cell shape and cell-cell interactions. For instance, SKU5-similar proteins encode an extracellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein involved in directional root growth in expanding cells. Mutants in this gene phenocopy the growth patterns seen on orbit in that they over-skew to the left (Sedbrook et al. , 2002 ). FASCICLIN-like arabinogalactans have been shown to positively modulate ABA-regulated root growth patterns in plants exposed to abiotic stress, and it is postulated that they function by interacting with mediators of ABA in a plasma membrane subdomain (Seifert et al. , 2014 ). Fasciclins are typically associated with the outer face of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane via their GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor (Johnson et al. , 2003 ; Demir et al. , 2013 ). Two cell wall–associated lipid transfer proteins are also differentially represented in the differential spaceflight proteome (light gray highlight in Fig. 6 ). There is strong representation of cell wall peroxidases (green highlight in Fig. 6 ) ( e.g. , Bellincampi et al. , 2014 ) and cell wall lectins (brown highlight in Fig. 6 ) ( e.g. , Kauss and Glaser 1974 ; Albenne et al. , 2009 ) in the network, connecting key metabolism, stress response, and cell expansion activities in the network of proteins differentially regulated by spaceflight. There are also a number of proteins that are connected by a domain of unknown function (DUF) deeply involved in cell wall metabolism (lower left in Fig. 6 ) ( e.g. , Garza-Caligaris et al. , 2012 ; Vazquez-Lobo et al. , 2012 ). These proteomics studies offered an initial opportunity to potentially integrate information on spaceflight responses at the protein and mRNA levels in that these samples were derived from very similar grow-outs on the ISS to the transcriptomics studies of Paul et al. ( 2013 ). A direct comparison of differential protein levels and their corresponding transcript expression levels does show some correlation. However, only a small portion of the differential transcripts are represented in the differential protein levels, and vice versa. This is, however, in agreement with previous studies in yeast (Futcher et al. , 1999 ; Gygi et al. , 1999 ; Washburn et al. , 2003 ), mice (Tian et al. , 2004 ), Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Nie et al. , 2006 ), E. coli (Ishihama et al. , 2005 ), Tragopogon (Koh et al. , 2012 ), and cotton (Hu et al. , 2013 ), showing that transcript abundances only partially predict protein abundances and that a series of regulatory processes involved in translation, localization, modification, and protein degradation play a substantial role in controlling protein expression (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012 ). Nonetheless, conclusions based on the proteomics and transcriptomics levels closely interrelate when examining protein name or function as opposed to strict TAIR accession number. The exact same gene/protein may not be represented in the corresponding transcriptome, yet the differential proteome from these samples displays a similar engagement of cell wall remodeling tools in response to spaceflight as seen in the transcriptome from similar samples. Roots and leaves adapt differently to spaceflight at the level of proteomics. While there are some commonalities among the spaceflight proteome changes in roots and leaves, such as cell wall metabolism, the present data indicate that roots and leaves invoke differential proteome responses to spaceflight. This is consistent with transcriptome data that also indicate differential spaceflight responses in leaves and roots (Paul et al. , 2013 ). It is likely that, as proteomics technologies as well as gene expression and other omics technologies achieve increased density of coverage and finer spatial resolution, it will be revealed that different cell types within organs respond differently to spaceflight. And as increased numbers of biological experiments are enabled on the ISS, it is likely that multiple approaches will combine to yield both cell-specific response pathways as well as more general principles involved in plant spaceflight adaptation. Cell wall modifications in spaceflight, in addition to or governed by auxin signaling, may be one of those general and recurring metabolic adaptations that may be in common among plants and plant tissues, even if enacted by various proteins and genes that differ among cell types or genotypes.",
