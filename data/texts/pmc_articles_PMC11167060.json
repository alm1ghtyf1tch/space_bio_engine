    "Results": "Primary changes in kidney function increase the risk of spaceflight-induced nephrolithiasis We analysed urinary and plasma parameters of interest for nephrolithiasis in 66 astronauts that stayed on the International Space Station (ISS) for up to 180 days. Values were analysed across time, including before, during and after flight. Our data showed an increased urinary excretion of metabolites and electrolytes that are considered risk factors for nephrolithiasis (Fig. 2 ). In the figure, urinary excretion of calcium is expressed as fractional excretion (FE Ca ). In the absence of plasma calcium abnormalities FE Ca should be < 1%; in astronauts, FE Ca increases significantly during flight. This urinary abnormality normalises on return to Earth (Fig. 2 ). A less significant increase was seen in oxalate, phosphate, uric acid urinary excretion during spaceflight, all rapidly decreasing at return with some parameters transiently overcorrecting. Urinary citrate did not significantly change and remained within the normal range. There was also a decrease in urinary volume during spaceflight and an increase in urinary osmolality (Fig. 2 ). Urinary electrolytes (chloride, sodium and potassium) remained stable during spaceflight compared to pre-flight with the exception of magnesium that, although within the normal range, significantly increased (Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Fig. 1A ). Calculated values including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), aldosterone:renin ratio, FE for urinary electrolytes and water, transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) and the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate (TmP) to GFR can be found in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1A, B . In addition, Supplementary Fig. 1C shows plasma values from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. Although these astronauts only spent 3 days in space, there was a degree of eGFR instability detected several months after returning to Earth. Fig. 2.

Although, most of the metabolite changes support the emergence of pro-lithogenic profile during spaceflight, they do not entirely explain the increased risk of nephrolithiasis in astronauts, suggesting that there might be other previously unidentified mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon. To investigate this, we initially explored RR-10 spaceflight mouse kidney tissue epiproteomic data to infer functional changes. Post-translational modifications of channels, transporters and pumps can alter their activity, and chief among these is phosphorylation status for which we noted several thousand significantly altered phosphosites (Fig. 3a ; Supplementary Data 1 ), suggesting a general increase in phosphatase and decrease in kinase activities (Fig. 3b ). In particular, two of the most dramatically dephosphorylated proteins were the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), encoded by SLC12A3 , expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (and validated by phospho-specific antibody staining in Fig. 3c ) and furosemide-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), encoded by SLC12A1 , expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Fig. 3a ). These transporters requires phosphorylation of key residues at their N-terminus for activation 20 , and NKCC2 is regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and genetic (i.e., Bartter syndrome) or pharmacological (e.g., furosemide) impairment of NKCC2 leads to hypercalciuria, and is associated with nephrolithiasis. Whereas changes in NCC activity can lead to alterations in calcium handling and bone mineral density. Fig. 3. Spaceflight-induced changes in the kidney phosphoproteome.

An FDR of 5% was used as a cutoff. N = 10 biologically independent animals per group (flight vs ground control). 4257 single-site phosphopeptides (Ser/Thr/Tyr) were used as initial input, 495 of which were matched to known kinase/phosphatase targets, that were then used to calculate respective predicted kinase/phosphatase activities.

To look for corroborating evidence of primary changes in renal function, we analysed plasma and kidney tissue multi-omic data from human and mouse samples (Fig. 4a ; Supplementary Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Data 2 ) for disease ontologies related to kidney stone formation. The nephrolithiasis and related ontologies were heavily represented across different datasets, providing orthogonal confirmation of real changes in the gene products comprising this ontology for spaceflight conditions vs controls. For example, α-tubulin ( TUB1A1 ) is known to protect against cell-crystal adhesion 21 but is decreased across multiple kidney datasets in our study (Fig. 5 ; Supplementary Data 3 ). In contrast, hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria ontologies were scantily represented, implying that standard terrestrial causes of dysregulated urinary calcium and oxalate were not particularly enriched and therefore not strongly implicated in kidney stone formation.

To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites). These differentially regulated gene products (DRGP) were ranked and represented in descending order using the following rules: (1) only DRGPs with a P -value < 0.05 by Wald test were counted as significant and plotted; (2) Each DRGP was assigned a score of +1 each time it was upregulated or −1 each time it was downregulated; (3) only DRGPs observed in proteome and transcriptome kidney-specific datasets were used for the calculation of the ranking score to avoid confounders, although additional datasets (epiproteome, epigenome and those from plasma/exosomes sources) were plotted for visualisation comparison purposes; (4) The resulting sum of scores for each DRGP was then calculated and multiplied by the number of times the DRGP was observed in the kidney-specific proteome and transcriptome datasets; (5) To increase confidence only DRGPs with a product score of absolute value 9 or higher (but excluding a score of 12) were plotted as these will have a directionality consensus of at least 3 datasets above the number of disagreeing datasets. The directional changes in nephrolithiasis-related faecal microbiome abundances between spaceflight and ground controls are illustrated in ( Fig. 4b ; Supplementary Data 4 ). Overall, these microbiota changes paint a mixed picture with some changes expected to confer a protective profile against nephrolithiasis and others tending to contribute to increased risk, implying that the increased urinary oxalate excretion is unlikely to be primarily diet or microbiota-dependent. Nevertheless, whole faecal microbiome KEGG analysis shows some enrichment of glyoxalate (a precursor to oxalate) and arginine metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Pathway analysis of novel plasma metabolomic data from humans and rodents under spaceflight conditions (Fig. 4c ; Supplementary Data 5 ) shows a striking over-representation of Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis metabolic pathways. Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis is the ubiquitous housekeeping process of charging amino acids to their cognate tRNAs and providing the substrates for global protein synthesis. In addition to this canonical function, it has become clear that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes including angiogenesis, inflammation, translational control and post translational modification 22 – 24 . Arginine metabolism has been implicated in toxic nephrolithiasis 25 and glycerophospholipids are the main lipid component of cell membranes and pathway enrichment is compatible with remodelling events (reviewed by Han 26 ). Citric Acid Cycle pathway is common to many metabolomic analyses of oxalosis. Structural remodelling of the nephron occurs within a month of spaceflight exposure To investigate whether renal remodelling was occurring in spaceflight, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis across 24 datasets obtained from 2 human and 13 rodent spaceflight missions and 2 rodent GCR simulation experiments. The datasets were epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic. GO pathways (Fig. 6a ; Supplementary Data 6 ) that are repeatedly significantly enriched across the datasets are compatible with remodelling events occurring in the kidney, these include regulation of cell adhesion, actin filament organisation, epithelial tube morphogenesis and renal system development pathways.

Enriched KEGG pathways (Fig. 6b ; Supplementary Data 7 likewise include focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction, sphingolipids, actin and cell cycle pathways, again consistent with remodelling. Proteomic analysis of urine from the Russian Roscosmos human spaceflight mission (Fig. 6c ) shows extracellular matrix (ECM) and lipid-turnover related proteins that were enriched 7 days after spaceflight compared to baseline. These include Fibronectin ( FN1 ; involved in the organisation of the ECM), Cathepsin B ( CTSB ; maintains turnover of glomerular basement membrane 27 ), Apolipoprotein H ( APOH ; which binds to cell surface phospholipids) and Proactivator Polypeptide ( PSAP ; involved in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids). Notable among these are Nidogen-1 ( NID1 ; a key part of the nephron basement membrane) and Podocalyxin ( PODXL ; a major constituent of the glycocalyx of podocytes in the glomerulus) which are two of the most frequently downregulated gene products across kidney datasets in our study (Fig. 5 ; Supplementary Data 3 ). To determine the extent of any potential structural remodelling, we looked for macroscopic changes in GCR and/or microgravity exposed rodent kidneys. Much like Elger and co-workers 11 , who found an increase in kidney weight of 30% in chronically potassium depleted animals, we found that microgravity (simulated) and microgravity+GCR (real and simulated) exposed animals had significantly greater kidney weights (relative to bodyweight) than control animals (Fig. 7a ). Fig. 7. Anatomical evidence for spaceflight-induced nephron remodelling. Open in a new tab a Morphometry of kidney mass was assessed by wet weights in 1 G, the weight of both left and right kidneys were averaged, and the kidney weights were normalised against bodyweight (BW) for the same animal and expressed as a percentage. All ground control and sham animals that received no exposure treatment were grouped into control. Animals that only received either full or simplified galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) simulations were grouped into GCR. Animals that only underwent hindlimb unloading microgravity simulation were grouped into microgravity (MG). Animals that underwent a combination of GCR and MG, or were exposed to spaceflight, were grouped into GCR + MG. Data are presented as mean ± SD.

Data are mean ± SD. P -value of 0.05 by students t-test was considered significant. N = 10 biologically independent animals per group. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. To establish that these changes weren’t merely due to alterations in extracellular fluid content, quantitative and qualitative histomorphometry was performed on mouse kidneys from the RR-10 spaceflight mission. Samples were stained for the canonical distal convoluted tubule marker Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC; encoded by SLC12A3 ), as this segment is known to be the most plastic in the nephron. Our data suggest that RR-10 mice have chronic dephosphorylation of NCC in addition to potentially altered basolateral potassium handling via Kir4.1/5.1 and KCC4, both of which are known to induce distal convoluted tubule remodelling 12 , 28 (Fig. 3a, c ; Supplementary Data 1 ). Qualitative assessment of 3D images of optically cleared tissues revealed no obvious lesions or anatomical abnormalities (See videos in Supplementary Movie 1 & 2 ). However, quantitative analysis of distal convoluted tubules revealed that spaceflight led to a reduction in tubule density, but that these retained tubules had a larger average size, demonstrating tubular segment remodelling (Fig. 7b, c ). Multi-omic analyses reveal convergent disease pathways induced by spaceflight To understand the common processes occurring across the multiple human and rodent, spaceflight and GCR exposed missions, omics data were analysed against DisGeNET, KEGG and GO databases. Significantly enriched kidney-relevant disease ontologies that were reproduced in our diverse cohort of datasets were plotted in Fig. 8 for DisGeNET (Supplementary Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Data 2 ). Fig. 8. Biomolecular evidence for spaceflight-induced kidney damage. Open in a new tab A curated list of enriched gene-disease associations are presented for DisGeNET ontological terms relevant to kidney health. These were ranked and represented in descending order using the following rules: 1) No. of mission datasets it replicated in; 2) most significant P -value; 3) greatest enrichment. To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites). An unadjusted, two-tailed Log 10 ( P -value) of 2 was considered significant for ontological term enrichment. Enrichment ratio; the number of differentially regulated hits in a dataset that belong to a given ontological term, normalised to the total number of statistically significant hits in the respective dataset. Many of the same ontologies are represented in both the spaceflight and simulated GCR experiments. Ontologies that are particularly enriched include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis, reflecting the presence of acute phase and inflammatory gene products in addition to the profibrotic and cell death gene products represented in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, renal fibrosis and renal insufficiency ontologies. The heavily enriched peripheral vascular disease and endothelial damage ontologies reflect the known endothelial and microvascular damage marker gene products enriched across the multiple GCR and spaceflight datasets. Mitochondrial diseases are enriched in the proteomics datasets of kidney tissues (Fig. 8 ) and is further supported by the enrichment of ontologies relating to mitochondrial suborganellular structures, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, cellular senescence, HIF-1 and TNFα signalling in GO (Supplementary Fig. 4 ; Supplementary Data 6 ) and KEGG (Supplementary Fig. 5 ; Supplementary Data 7 ) over-representation analyses. Mitochondria may also be showing signs of stress-induced fusion (Supplementary Fig. 6 ), although future studies would be needed to specifically address changes in mitochondria morphology. As a final step we used the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) 29 knowledge graph tool which is capable of integrating heterogeneous datasets from various biological levels, assay modalities, tissue types, organisms and experimental conditions to validate our findings (Supplementary Fig. 7 ). A GCR exposure with a dose-equivalent to a Mars roundtrip induces renal damage and dysfunction LEO spaceflight mission participants are exposed to comparatively low doses of GCR due to the protection provided by Earth’s magnetic field. Therefore, to disentangle the impacts of GCR from microgravity and evaluate the consequence of unmitigated GCR exposure, we examined tissues that had only been exposed to simulated GCR. To do this we utilised NASA’s ground-based GCR simulator at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where animals either had an acute exposure to a ~ 1.5-year dose-equivalent (0.5 Gy) in the simplified 6-beam/5-ion GCR simulator followed by rapid 24 h sacrifice (BNL experiments) or were given an acute exposure to a ~ 2.5-year dose-equivalent (0.75 Gy) in the full 33-beam/7-ion GCR simulator with sacrifice at 6 months post-exposure (NSRL-22A experiment). Pathogenic serum miRNA species have been previously implicated to mediate tissue damage in spaceflight 30 , and GCR is a plausible pathogenic factor. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of plasma miRNAs revealed three clusters that generally trended downward in BNL-1 (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). However, investigation of miRNA predicted mRNA targets and DisGeNET analysis of these targets suggested that these circulating miRNAs would be minor players in the context of renal damage in the acute setting (Supplementary Data 8 ). Retaining biomolecular information within the gross and micro-anatomical context is important, especially when highly heterogenous tissues like the kidney (Fig. 9a ). So, we next performed in situ hybridisation (RNAScope) and quantitative whole slide imaging to ascertain the presence and density of these pathogenic miRNAs in kidney tissues of BNL-3 mice. miR-125b was significantly increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) (Fig. 9b ), particularly in the vascular compartment (arrows) which corresponds to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the thin descending limb of the loop and the medullary collecting duct. miR-16 has a similar pattern of distribution and differential expression but fails to reach significance (Supplementary Fig. 9 ) . These miRNA species are implicated in vascular damage and the ISOM is also the site of the vascular bundle 31 , a complex structure which is the bottleneck of all blood flow to and from the inner medulla. Additionally, mRNA target prediction, KEGG and DisGeNET analysis of miR-125b and miR-16 suggest that these may mediate cell senescence, apoptosis, TGFβ signalling and oncogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 9 ).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. To further understand the effect of simulated GCR on the segment-specific cell types of the kidney’s nephron (Fig. 9a ), we performed 2D spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq 32 ) on BNL-1 GCR-exposed renal tissue. Cell types were inferred using a published renal cell atlas 33 , which were mapped onto individual data points which accurately reproduced anatomy (Fig. 9c ). Individual significant transcriptional changes in specific cell types were then examined and top hits were analysed by KEGG and DisGeNET (Fig. 9d ; Supplementary Data 10 ). Interestingly, immunoglobulin components were among the hits overexpressed by loop of Henle cells, presumably reflecting increased B-cell activity in the interstitium as supported by enrichment of the KEGG pathway for “leukocyte transendothelial migration” (Supplementary Data 10 ). SGK1 transcriptional activity was decreased in proximal convoluted and straight tubule cells (Fig. 9d ). SGK1 is a master regulator of multiple epithelial membrane transporters, including canonical segment specific transporters. The data also support disruption of circadian rhythm in several tubule segments via Cytochrome-1 and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (also known as Rev-Erbɑ; encoded by NR1D1 ) 34 (Fig. 9d ), and hits on KEGG and DisGeNET (Supplementary Data 10 ). When it comes to damage markers, again the proximal straight tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle appear to be the most impacted, with decrease in ALAS1 , and increases in ANGPT2 and KRT18 all prognostically poor for renal outcomes 35 – 37 (Fig. 9d ). From a radiobiological perspective, the kidney is considered a late-responding tissue, and studies spanning at least 1-2 years may be required to appreciate the full impact of chronic GCR exposure on kidney health 38 . Although, some features of radiation-induced nephropathy and sub-clinical manifestations can emerge in < 6 months post-irradiation. To investigate this, serial tissue sections from NSRL-22A mice were histochemically stained for routine examination of potential kidney damage (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome stain, Martius Scarlet Blue) were examined by a blinded expert histopathologist (Fig. 10a ).

No histological evidence of differences in interstitial fibrosis or tissue calcifications were observed between Sham and GCR exposed tissues stained with PAS, Picrosirius Red and Von Kossa (Fig. 10a ). To confirm this, we quantitated the fractional interstitial area in the PAS stains which showed no difference between groups (mean 6.10% ± 2.10 vs 6.16% ± 2.27. p = 0.9623). As previously reported, first signs of fibrosis or calcifications may not present until after 6 months 38 , and therefore NSRL-22A may be too short a period to observe these disease features, despite significant enrichment of fibrosis-related DisGeNET ontologies in the kidney proteomics from the same animals (Supplementary Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Data 2 ). However, consistent with radiation-induced nephropathy, overt thrombotic microangiopathy was detected in GCR exposed tissues from 27% (3/11) female animals, and 0% (0/12) male animals. None was seen in tissue from sham exposed animals (Fig. 10a ). Given the biomolecular and histopathological signs of renal injury, we then looked for functional evidence of glomerular, proximal tubular and distal tubular dysfunction. Urinary and plasma biochemical analyses (Fig. 10b ; Supplementary Fig. 10 ) showed significantly greater urinary protein excretion in GCR vs sham animals, consistent with a glomerular lesion or proximal tubule dysfunction, the latter supported by the reduction in the endocytic receptor megalin ( LRP2 ) which normally reabsorbs proteins that escape into the ultrafiltrate (Fig. 5 ). There was a slight increase in urinary glucose, which is a highly specific, but not very sensitive marker of proximal tubular dysfunction in non-diabetic animals. While this did not reach significance ( p = 0.1198), there was significant downregulation of sodium-glucose linked transporter, SGLT1 ( SLC5A1 ) (Fig. 5 ), that would be consistent with proximal tubule dysfunction. Finally, there was significantly greater magnesiuria in GCR exposed animals, consistent with downregulated magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle or the distal convoluted tubule.",
    "Conclusion": "We have presented a large volume of data encompassing both human and rodent data, extant and novel multi-omics datasets, historical and extant clinical chemistry and novel imaging data from 16 spaceflight missions and 4 GCR exposures to examine the effect of spaceflight on kidney function. Tubular remodelling, by which we mean structural and functional adaptation of the tubular nephron to environmental stimuli, is a well described yet underappreciated phenomenon. Tubular remodelling occurs not only in response to genetic modification of signal pathways 39 , but also chronic diuretic exposure 40 , kidney injury 41 , and both chronic 11 and acute 42 hypokalaemia. These changes occur rapidly, within 3 days of diet induced hypokalaemia 12 . Our data robustly and orthogonally supports tubular remodelling occurring in microgravity with and without GCR. This is highly likely to have functional consequences, as tubular remodelling does in other scenarios 39 . Renal remodelling in microgravity (possibly related to the cephalad fluid shift) may therefore be a primary event that causes subsequent dysregulation of serum and urine electrolyte homeostasis. This is supported by the prompt return to baseline of humans on return to terrestrial gravity. Changes in urinary biochemistry are known to be critical in the pathogenesis of kidney stone formation; a condition that occurs disproportionally commonly in astronauts, and that is potentially mission critical. The increased risk for nephrolithiasis in space has been historically attributed to the negative impact of microgravity on bone mineral density that leads to increased resorption of bone, release of calcium salts in the bloodstream, increased renal load and therefore increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate 6 , 8 . Our historical data (from 66 astronauts) confirms hypercalciuria, and the phosphoproteomic data shows decreased phosphorylation of NKCC2 ( SLC12A1 ), which will cause decreased paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations in the loop of Henle, and thus renal calcium and magnesium wasting. Hypocitraturia was not observed; this is in line with previous observations by Pietryzk et al. of an approximate rate of 14% of hypocitraturia during spaceflight 6 , and Whitson et al. who found no significant hypocitraturia 8 . Hyperoxaluria also occurs during spaceflight. Oxalate is freely filtered by the glomerulus and almost entirely excreted in the urine. Increased urinary oxalate reflects increased plasma oxalate load that could come from either increased endogenous liver production or increased absorption by the gut. The latter could be caused by several conditions such as increased dietary oxalate, malabsorptive conditions or altered microbiome. Dietary data were not available, and we assumed an absence of malabsorptive conditions. However, we do know that spaceflight affects the gut microbiome 43 . Metagenomic analysis of the microbiome showed that in the highest quality faecal microbiome dataset (namely RR-23) Oxalobacter sp., the bacterium primarily responsible for oxalate metabolism 44 , increases during spaceflight. Bacteroides, a bacterium that was found to be increased in stone formers 45 , and Bifidobacterium, a pro-biotic able to metabolise oxalate in the gut 46 , were enriched and depleted in spaceflight respectively. It is difficult, based on low replicability of data to ascribe a primary, or even secondary microbiome-related aetiology for increased stone formation in spaceflight. Proposed interventions to prevent potential mission critical kidney stone formation in spaceflight include increasing urine output by maximising oral fluid intake 47 , oral potassium citrate 48 (or potassium magnesium citrate 49 ) supplementation and inflight management, including ureteral stenting 50 and lithotripsy 51 . While these are sensible and may indeed be effective, none deal with the hypercalciuria that has been consistently shown in human space travellers. Oral or parenteral bisphosphonates have been used with some success 52 . Further, thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion 53 (possibly by ECV contraction causing increased proximal tubular calcium reabsorption 54 ) and reduce age related bone mineral density loss 55 , and could represent a “two birds with one stone” therapeutic option. Could the dephosphorylation of NKCC2 guide us toward a therapeutic target to reduce spaceflight induced hypercalciuria? NKCC2 activity is modulated by the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) via phosphorylation 56 , and calcilytics (CaSR antagonists), well tolerated but disappointing agents in their utility for treating terrestrial osteoporosis 57 , might be one potential avenue to manipulate NKCC2 activity to ameliorate spaceflight induced hypercalciuria. Abnormal water homeostasis has been noted in astronauts since the early days of spaceflight, with a marked reduction in both diuresis and natriuresis with vasopressin dysregulation via unknown mechanisms 1 – 3 . In fact, the reduced NKCC2 activity would conversely be anticipated to enhance diuresis, much like a loop diuretic. In this context, downregulation of prostaglandin transporters (PGT; encoded by SLCO2A1 ), a result seen in multiple of our proteomic and transcriptomic datasets (Fig. 5 ), is intriguing and may offer a way to reconcile this paradox. As carriers of a gain-of-function mutation of SLCO2A1 58 , see a reduction in PGT activity in the proximal straight tubule and the cortical collecting duct which colocalises with Aquaporin-2 ( AQP2 ). Loss of PGT-mediated reabsorption by collecting duct principal cells, causes a subsequent build-up in the luminal concentration of the prostaglandin PGE 2 , which stimulates apical prostaglandin E 2 receptor 4 (EP 4 ) receptors to activate Aquaporin-2 and inappropriate water reabsorption. In our study the loss of NKCC2 activity through dephosphorylation and reduction of PGT abundance can offset each other. Tubular remodelling in spaceflight raises another, interesting question; is the hypercalciuria seen in spaceflight a consequence or cause of spaceflight related loss of bone mineral density (BMD)? We know that primary renal phenomena associated with tubular remodelling (e.g. genetic inactivation of SLC12A1 in Bartter syndrome 59 or chronic furosemide exposure 60 ) can cause a loss of BMD as a consequence of the primary hypercalciuria. This implies that renally targeted therapies (e.g. thiazides, calcilytics) will be effective. There does appear to be a synergistic effect of microgravity and GCR on BMD loss; GCR does have primary bone effects, increasing osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in rodents 16 , so bone targeted countermeasures will still be relevant. The kidney is a key microvascular end-organ and microvascular disease appears to be one of the main consequences of GCR exposure 30 . We concur with this view: vascular disease and endothelial dysfunction disease ontologies were highly enriched across omics datasets (Fig. 8 ). Consistent with this, the arginine biosynthesis pathway was highly enriched across our human and mouse datasets (Fig. 4c ), there was a significantly increased amount of pathogenic miR-125b in the highly vascular ISOM (Fig. 9b ) and as a likely consequence of this microvascular pathology, we observed incidences of thrombotic microangiopathy on histopathological examination (Fig. 10a ). In addition to this, pathophysiological macrovascular changes are a well-documented consequence of microgravity, with 6 months in space shown to induce ~ 20 years of vascular ageing through arterial stiffening 61 . The resultant loss of vascular elasticity, and thus buffering capacity, leads to elevated transmission of blood flow and pressure pulsatility to the microvasculature. Long-term, this can cause barotrauma or oxidative stress to renal microvasculature due to suboptimal perfusion, especially as the myogenic response of the afferent arteriole is to vasoconstrict and provide resistance (and thus reduce flow) in the face of excessive pulsatile pressure 62 . Indeed arterial stiffness and CKD are strongly associated, and it is thought that one begets the other in a positive feedback loop 63 . Taken together with the general drop in blood pressure experienced by astronauts 64 , exposure to spaceflight long-term places the kidney in an impossible position whereby it must choose whether to defend renal perfusion or the health of its microvasculature. If the arterioles dilate to enhance blood flow, they leave the microvasculature open to damage from unbuffered pressure waves on top of the radiation damage caused by GCR. Whereas if they constrict to provide protection to the microvasculature, they reduce blood flow and therefore oxygen supply to the renal tubules, which further compounds and exacerbates the chronic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction from GCR bombardment. This study is the largest to ever look at the effect of spaceflight on kidney function. We have demonstrated that there is renal structural and functional remodelling likely caused by microgravity, probably synergistically with GCR. We have shown that this remodelling is a potential driver of kidney stone formation and many of the changes in the urinary biochemistry of humans and animals experienced by those exposed to LEO spaceflight. We have also shown that acute exposure to simulated GCR causes both acute and chronic tubular epithelial and vascular damage that appears both progressive and irreversible. However, our study has several limitations. We have necessarily relied on human (mostly male) and animal (mostly female) data from missions which were exposed to microgravity for relatively short periods of time compared to the projected length of a Mars mission, and only in LEO, which also limited the amount of GCR and other space radiation that they were exposed to. Additionally, our simulated GCR experiments only looked at acute unfractionated dosing, which may not accurately model the chronic cumulative exposure that would happen on a Mars mission. Therefore, in the absence of experiments that can more accurately model the long-term simultaneous exposure to full GCR and microgravity over several years, and the plausible synergistic impact of these insults, our results should be taken a conservative glimpse into the potential dire health consequences of long-term deep space travel. Much more intensive study of the health impacts of spaceflight on the kidneys and other visceral organs that have received little attention is of the utmost importance if we are to develop mitigation strategies and send humans to other planets and beyond.",
