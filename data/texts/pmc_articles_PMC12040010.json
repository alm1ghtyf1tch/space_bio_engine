    "Abstract": "Abstract Rationale: Central nervous system (CNS) infections caused by Cryptococcus albidus are rarely reported, but are often associated with high mortality rates. Clinical data on the appropriate use of liposomal-amphotericin B (liposomal-AmB) with cryptococcal meningitis are limited. Here, we report for the first time the efficacious and safe use of the ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB for a severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. We also review the cases of CNS infection caused by C albidus and its related species. Patient concerns: A severely obese female patient was admitted to neurosurgical ward with lesions in the intracranial space and accompanying headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal and left frontal insular region. After glioma resection, C albidus was isolated from her cerebrospinal fluid samples. Diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes: She diagnosed histopathologically with a Cryptococcus species infection. The culture from her cerebrospinal fluid sample showed the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C albidus with mass spectrometry. She was treated with liposomal-AmB (50 mg day -1 intravenously) plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day -1 orally in 4 divided doses) for 6 weeks. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge. Lessons: CNS infections of C albidus were uncommon. Using ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB should be considered for severely obese patients with C albidus meningitis.

The lesion in the right parietal lobe was resected, whereas the lesion in the left frontal lobe (red arrow) was still observed with long signals on T1-weighted (A) and T2-weighted (B) images. Enhanced MRI scanning showed that the lesion was only mildly enhanced after treatment (C). Table 1. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.

    "Conclusion": "C albidus in the genus Cryptococcus , is a rare species that causes cryptococcal infections, especially in the CNS infections. The antifungal treatment recommended for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is liposomal-AmB plus flucytosine. [ 10 , 11 ] Although liposomal-AmB has been used for several decades, little is known about its pharmacokinetics in obese patients. [ 12 , 13 ] The prescribing information for cryptococcal disease recommends weight-based doses of 0.7 to 6 mg/kg/day AmB, depending upon the AmB product used. To date, the calculation of the appropriate dose for severely obese patients is controversial. [ 13 , 14 ] Animal studies have demonstrated significantly increased AmB serum concentrations and increased rates of nephrotoxicity in obese rats and rabbits, with poor distribution of adipose tissue. [ 15 ] Furthermore, women have a higher body fat rate than men, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury caused by liposomal-AmB. [ 16 ] Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider the ideal bodyweight rather than the actual bodyweight when calculating the dose of liposomal-AmB for severely obese female patients. In this case, we have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of using the ideal bodyweight, rather than the actual bodyweight, to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB for a severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in accordance with the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis.” [ 17 – 19 ] Studies of case report relevant to CNS infections attributed to C albidus and its related species in the PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases from their inception until July 2024. The following key words were used: fungus, human infection, CNS, meningitis, ventriculitis, encephalitis, non-neoformans, cryptococcus, naganishia, adeliensis, albida, albidus, chernovii, curvatus, diffluens, friedmannii, liquefaciens, magnus, terreus, uniguttulatus, and uzbekitanensis. The references in each manuscript were also reviewed to identify additional cases. Our searches yielded 104 potentially relevant records. After nonhuman species (e.g., dog, cat, pigeon) were excluded, [ 20 , 21 ] 86 studies were included. After non-CNS cases, non-research studies, non- Cryptococcus, C neoformans species complex, and C gattii species complex infections were excluded, [ 10 , 22 – 28 ] 17 studies were reported. Of those 17 studies, 7 were cohort studies of Cryptococcus , [ 11 , 29 – 34 ] and 1 study was of C laurentii meningitis combined with C albidus cryptococcaemia. [ 35 ] Finally, 9 cases of CNS infections caused by C albidus or its related species have been reported. The risk factors, manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment for these pathogens are presented in table 2 . Like other Cryptococcus species, C albidus and its related species were commonly isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts and droppings of birds. [ 2 , 36 ] There is, as yet, no explanation of how humans contract these infections. Reasons may include the worldwide increase in immunocompromised patients, the widespread use of immunosuppressive agents, and the prolonged use of central venous catheters or indwelling devices. [ 9 ] In our systematic review of the literature, we detected 2 cases of infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults and 4 in apparently immunodeficient individuals. [ 3 , 7 , 9 , 38 ] Leukemia and cancer are important risk factors in HIV-negative patients. [ 36 , 37 , 39 ] The administration of corticosteroids agents, exposure to bird excrement, contact with animals, and surgery are also risk factors for these infections. [ 2 , 3 , 36 ] Table 2.

Patients can present with headache, fever, altered mental state, nausea, and vomiting. Headache is the commonest symptom, and only 1 patient reported no headache. [ 7 ] Although fever is possible, it only presented in 3 cases (31%). These results are similar to a cohort study that showed fever present in 28% of cases. [ 29 ] Patients also presented with increased intracranial pressure increasing and altered mental states, and these neurological symptoms are similar to other cryptococcal infections. [ 28 ] The cryptococcal capsule lodges in the arachnoid villi and subsequently prevents CSF reabsorption may explain the elevated intracranial pressure. [ 40 ] Culture and API® strip assimilation test are laboratory commonly used methods to identify isolated Cryptococcus species. [ 7 , 38 , 39 ] However, it may be difficult to identify species when only 1 or 2 methods are used. Without the sequence of the D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), some rare Cryptococcus species can be misidentified as C albidus . [ 8 , 27 , 41 ] For example, a yeast isolate was initially identified as C albidus with an API® strip assimilation test. However, after the internal transcribed spacer and the D1/D2 domains of the large-subunit rRNA were sequenced, the isolate was finally confirmed as C liquefaciens . [ 38 ] Mass spectrometry is a new methodology for identifying bacterial species, and some studies have shown that the accuracy of mass spectrometry for their identification is over 95% at the species level. [ 42 – 44 ] Hence, the identification of C albidus based on VITEK mass spectrometry is reliable. Because these fungi are infrequent causes of disease, there are no evidence-based guidelines or standard recommendations for their treatment. The susceptibility of C albidus and its related species to antifungal agents is shown in Table 3 . The cumulative experience reported in the published literature suggests that AmB is the only agent to which C albidus and its related species are consistently sensitive. [ 45 , 46 ] Therefore, AmB is a safe and effective drug for use as initial induction therapy against these infections in the CNS. However, consideration should be given henceforth to submitting these clinical isolates for susceptibility testing and proper identification to guide subsequent therapeutic decisions. To date, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to optimize the choice of AmB or the duration of its therapy. We recommend: (1) using liposomal-AmB instead of AmB deoxycholate because liposomal-AmB is safer and more rapidly sterilizes the CSF than AmB deoxycholate [ 11 , 12 , 32 ] ; (2) at least 1 g of AmB during treatment and prolonged treatment are recommended. [ 47 ] (3) The combination of AmB and 5-fluorocytosine, is recommended because it has been shown to reduce the toxicity of this drug and reduce the relapse rate of C albidus infections.
