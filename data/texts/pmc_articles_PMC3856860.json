    "Abstract": "Abstract Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 ± 5 μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 ± 6 μm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 ± 0.6 μm) versus that of control (18.0 ± 0.8 μm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.

    "Results": "Body and Soleus Muscle Mass Body mass was not different among Con (439 ± 11 g), 7-d HU (425 ± 12 g) and 14-d HU (418 ± 10 g) rats. Soleus muscle mass of 7-d HU (198 ± 13 mg) and 14-d HU (187 ± 8 mg) rats was lower than that of Con animals (269 ± 30 mg). Soleus muscle atrophy in HU rats is characteristic of reduced skeletal muscle weight-bearing activity and confirms the effectiveness of the hindlimb unloading treatment. Central Hemodynamics In Con rats, heart rate following 10-min of unloading was higher than that in 7- and 14-d HU rats during the unloaded condition ( Table 1 ). When the animals were reloaded, heart rate was higher in the 7-d HU (451 ± 12 beats/min) and 14-d HU (454 ± 10 beats/min) groups relative to that in the Con rats (427 ± 9 beats/min) during standing. Mean caudal tail arterial pressure was not different between Con and 7-d HU rats during unloading, but it was higher in both groups relative to that in 14-d HU rats ( Table 1 ). During reloading, mean caudal tail artery pressure did not differ among groups (Con, 130 ± 4 mmHg; 7-d HU, 127 ± 4 mmHg; 14-d HU, 128 ± 3 mmHg). Table 1.

Skeletal Blood Flow and Vascular Resistance During unloading, femoral bone and marrow blood flow ( Table 1 ) and vascular resistance did not differ among the three groups. With reloading, blood flow increased in the proximal metaphysis, diaphyseal marrow and distal metaphysis of Con rats, but only increased in the diaphyseal marrow of 7- and 14-d HU rats. During standing, blood flow in 14-d HU rats was lower in all four of the regions of the femur relative to that in Con rats ( Fig 2 ). Likewise, vascular resistance in all regions of the femur was higher in 14-d HU rats during reloading ( Fig 3 ). Figure 2.

PNA Structural Characteristics Chronic skeletal unloading induced a remodeling of the femoral PNA ( Fig 4 ). Using videomicroscopy, maximal intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (146 ± 7 μm) was smaller than that from Con rats (177 ± 10 μm). Likewise, PNA medial wall thickness in 14-d HU rats (16 ± 2 μm) was thinner than that from Con animals (22 ± 2 μm). Results derived using histomorphometric techniques were similar to those obtained with videomicroscopy. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats was 15% smaller than that from Con rats and medial wall thickness was 21% thinner in 14-d HU rats ( Table 2 ). The smaller diameters and thinner medial walls resulted in a 23% smaller medial cross-sectional area in PNAs from 14-d HU animals ( Table 2 ). Figure 4.

PNA Shear Stress and Circumferential Stress Unloading-induced reductions in blood flow to the femoral diaphysis and marrow resulted in a lower calculated shear stress in the femoral PNA ( Fig 5A ). However, the remodeling of the PNA to reduce luminal diameter in HU rats ( Fig 4 ) resulted in a similar PNA shear stress in the unloaded condition to that in Con rat PNAs under the control standing condition ( Fig 5A ). Figure 5.

The lower arterial pressure in the hindlimb of HU rats during unloading ( Table 1 ) resulted in a lower calculated PNA circumferential wall stress ( Fig 5B ). This diminished circumferential wall stress was normalized to Con levels through the unloading-induced PNA remodeling to reduce medial wall thickness ( Fig 5B ).",
    "Conclusion": "Previous work has shown that as little as 10 min of skeletal unloading reduces bone and marrow perfusion of long bones [ 6 )]. Given that chronic changes in local hemodynamic conditions (e.g., blood flow and arterial pressure) can induce vascular remodeling and impact tissue blood flow capacity [ 23 – 25 ], the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether 7-d and 14-d of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow perfusion and vascular resistance during reloading, and to investigate whether putative changes in bone blood flow during reloading are associated with a structural remodeling of the femoral PNA. Results from the present study provide the first evidence that chronic skeletal disuse decreases the bone and marrow hyperemia ( Fig 2 ) and elevates bone vascular resistance ( Fig 3 ) during reloading, as well as induces a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature. The remodeling of bone resistance arteries ( Fig 4 ) appears to be driven by alterations in mechanical forces within the arterial vasculature that were induced during the unloading treatment, including decreases in blood flow (shear stress, Fig 5A ) and hindlimb arterial pressure (circumferential wall stress, Fig 5B ). Further, the vascular remodeling served to normalize intraluminal shear stress and circumferential wall stress to levels equivalent to that in control standing rats. While gross structural remodeling of bone resistance arteries occurs to maintain a type of mechanical homeostasis within the artery during unloading ( Fig 5 ), these changes in arterial structure may have adverse consequences with reloading. For example, the structural narrowing of the resistance vasculature could function to limit bone and marrow blood flow capacity and contribute to the elevations in vascular resistance during reloading. Previous studies have also provided evidence that vascular remodeling occurs within bone during prolonged disuse. For example, Doty et al. [ 36 ] reported that the vascular space (area) in the diaphyseal region of the tibia in rats flown 12.5 days in space on a Cosmos biosatellite tended to be lower than that in ground control animals. The lack of statistical significance was attributed to the low number of animals studied ( n = 5 per group). Fei et al. (17) have also demonstrated small vessel rarefaction in the tibial metaphysis of 21-d HU rats using a technique to quantify microvascular network structure that does not differentiate between arteries, veins and capillaries or include larger microvessels of the size of resistance arteries [ 37 ]. And using sciatic neurectomy to generate unilateral disuse in the rat hindlimb, Matsumoto et al. [ 38 ] investigated disuse effects on the pervasive canal network in cortical bone of the tibia during growth. This canal network provides the infrastructure for vascular distribution throughout bone. Fourteen wks of disuse decreased canal number and density, as well as diminishing periosteal and endocortical bone formation. The authors speculated that the less dense canal network would be accompanied by a lower perfusion rate [ 38 ], which could adversely affect the fluid pressure gradient and fluid flow between the endosteal vasculature and periosteal lympathics [ 39 , 40 ]. An active transmural pressure gradient and fluid flow is rudimentary to the bone formation process [ 8 ]. Collectively, these studies suggest several types of unloading-induced vascular adaptations in bone: 1) a narrowing of bone resistance arteries [present study], which could negatively impact the bulk flow of oxygen and nutrients into bone, cellular transport, and ultimately the bulk fluid flow through capillaries into the interstitial spaces [ 9 , 10 , 35 ], and 2) rarefaction of the bone microvascular network and supporting infrastructure [ 17 , 36 , 38 ], which among other things could impair potential signaling between the vascular endothelium and bone remodeling units [ 11 , 14 – 16 ]. The consequences of insufficient perfusion of bone and marrow during loading could be severe. Ischemic bone is susceptible to several deleterious effects, including loss of osteocytes [ 41 ] and diminished osteoblast activity [ 42 ]. Interestingly, osteoclast activity is seemingly unperturbed by similar decrements in blood supply [ 42 ]. McCarthy [ 43 ] has suggested that hypoxia produced by inadequate blood flow would be accompanied by slight decreases in pH, which could serve to stimulate osteoclast activity. Bone marrow ischemia is also a precursor to osteonecrosis [ 44 ]. Although there is no evidence that unloading-induced decrements in blood flow during reloading are severe enough to provoke osteonecrosis, an underperfusion of bone and marrow could have adverse effects on bone structure and health, particularly if the energetic requirements of metabolically active bone cells exceed the capacity of the vasculature to provide sufficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Additionally, under such low-flow conditions there may be a diminished influence of systemic factors on bone tissue and a concomitant increase in the dependency and influence of local factors in bone. The classic theory of vascular remodeling holds that it is stimulated by local hypoxemia [ 45 , 46 ]. While still an important factor, hypoxia may not be the direct impetus for alterations in vascular structure. Rather, it appears that arteries respond to changes in mechanical stress and strain by remodeling their gross structural properties in order to maintain a type of mechanical homeostasis [ 23 ]. In conduit arteries, for example, structure is maintained by “normal” blood flow (shear stress) and “normal” arterial pressure (circumferential wall stress) [ 23 , 46 ]. Deviations from this hemodynamic status quo are critical mechanisms to induce vascular remodeling [ 45 , 46 ]. For instance, research on large conduit arteries reveals that decreases in blood flow through the artery reduces wall shear stress, and this induces a remodeling that diminishes luminal diameter and correspondingly serves to normalize wall shear stress [ 22 ]. Likewise, hypertension increases the circumferential wall stress of arteries and elicits an adaptive thickening of the media layer of the arterial wall that consequently serves to lower circumferential wall stress [ 23 ]. Much of what is known regarding the mechanisms that induce vascular remodeling has come from studies of conduit arteries exposed to increases and decreases in blood flow or increases in arterial pressure [ 23 , 24 , 45 , 46 ]. Large conduit arteries, however, are not subjected to the same physical or chemical environment (e.g., altered tissue oxygenation and local pH) of small resistance arteries within tissue. Only a relatively small number of studies have investigated the remodeling of resistance arteries and few of these contain measures necessary to determine changes in resistance artery shear stress or circumferential wall stress. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine the effects of changes in the hydrodynamic mechanical environment on the bone vasculature. Although the bone vasculature is unique in many ways [ 9 , 10 , 35 , 43 , 44 ], the results demonstrate that bone resistance arteries also remodel to maintain a mechanical homeostasis during conditions of prolonged disuse and unloading ( Fig 5A & 5B ). The structural modification of the femoral PNA to decrease wall thickness in response to chronic reductions in hindlimb arterial pressure could make the vessels more susceptible to degeneration or disruption of the vascular wall, as was observed to occur in the tibia of spaceflown rats following 2-d of reloading [ 36 ]. Likewise, the narrowing of the PNA maximal intraluminal diameter in response to the chronic unloading-induced decreases in blood flow could impose a structural limitation on oxygen and nutrient delivery to the bone and marrow upon return to weight bearing activity. In conclusion, results from the present study confirm previous observations [ 6 ] that skeletal unloading decreases long bone blood flow ( Table 1 ). The results further demonstrate that this prolonged skeletal disuse impairs the ability of the vasculature to augment bone and marrow blood flow upon reloading ( Fig 2 ). The diminished hyperemic response is the result of elevations in vascular resistance within the bone and marrow ( Fig 3 ) and is associated with a remodeling of the resistance vasculature ( Fig 4 ). This arterial remodeling served to maintain shear stress ( Fig 5A ) and circumferential wall stress ( Fig 5B ) through decreases in maximal diameter and medial wall thickness, respectively, in the face of a diminished blood flow and hindlimb arterial pressure. The functional consequences of the structural narrowing of resistance arteries in particular could serve to limit bone and marrow blood flow capacity and possibly contribute to bone ischemia during reloading or physical activity.",
