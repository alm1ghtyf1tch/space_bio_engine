    "Results": "To identify specific cellular microenvironments affected by spaceflight, we combined the techniques of spatial transcriptomics (ST; 10X Genomics Visium) and single-nucleus multiomics (snMultiomics; gene expression and chromatin accessibility; 10× Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression) on mouse brain. In total, we analyzed three brains from mice euthanized on-board of the International Space Station (ISS; F1, F2, F3) and three brains from ground control mice (G1, G2, G3) that were kept under matched conditions (see Animals in Methods). For each sample, we isolated nuclei from one hemisphere for snMultiomics analysis and cryo-sectioned the other hemisphere for ST analysis with the focus on the hippocampal region (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1. Summary of the project workflow. Open in a new tab Overview of the study workflow where brains from International Space Station (ISS; Flight mice) and ground control mouse groups (Ground control mice) were split into the two hemispheres for Spatial Gene Expression Analysis (Spatial Transcriptomics or ST) and Single Nuclei Multiomics analysis (snMultiomics). Spaceflight sample quality is suitable for ST and snMultiomics analysis As a first step, we ensured that the morphological and RNA quality of the samples was suitable for our experimental workflow given that the spaceflown samples had undergone a specific preservation approach 17 , which was also used for the corresponding ground control animals (see Animals in Methods). We measured the RNA integrity number (RIN) for each sample and found that it was 9.15 on average (Supplementary Fig. 1A ). Furthermore, we performed a tissue optimization experiment confirming that both RNA integrity and tissue morphology was of sufficient quality for ST analysis (see Visium Spatial Gene Expression technology and sequencing in Methods; Supplementary Fig. 1B ). snMultiomics dissects the effects of spaceflight on different cell types in spaceflown mouse brains To dissect the alterations induced by spaceflight at the single-nucleus level, we performed a snMultiomics analysis on hemispheres of three spaceflown (F1, F2, F3) mice and two out of three ground controls (G2, G3), obtaining RNA expression profiles (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) information from the same nucleus. In total, we isolated 21,178 nuclei across the spaceflight and control samples with an average of 3140 unique transcripts (Unique Molecular Identifier or UMI) per nucleus (i.e., from snRNA-seq) and 9217 peaks per nucleus (i.e., from snATAC-seq) (Fig. 2A, B ; Supplementary Fig. 1C ) and an overall high gene expression correlation between the spaceflight and ground control samples ( r = 0.95, p < 0.05; Fig. 2C ). By integrating snRNASeq and snATAC-seq data and performing a joint clustering analysis, we identified 18 snMultiomics clusters (Fig. 2D ; Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2.

This is a two-sided Pearson correlation test with 95% confidence intervals performed on the average expression (log(1 + avgUMI)). avgUMI: average UMI counts per spot. Next, we leveraged previously reported marker genes in the literature (see Gene and cluster annotation in Methods for details) to identify 11 macro categories for the 18 snMultiomics clusters (interchangeably referred to as multiomics clusters in the next sections) according to their functions (Fig. 2E ; Supplementary Data 1 , 2 ). The majority of clusters were related to neurogenesis, neuronal activity and synaptic transmission, distinguished by differences in neurotransmitters (GABAergic, glutamatergic, dopaminergic) and based on gene expression patterns, tentatively associated with neuronal locations in hypothalamus, striatum, cortex and hippocampus. We identified a total of 825 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spaceflown and ground control samples across all multiomics clusters (Supplementary Data 3 ). The majority of these 825 DEGs were involved in neuronal development (multiomics clusters 9, 11), axonal or dendritic outgrowth (multiomics cluster 9), and synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 4), including specifically GABAergic synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 11). Comparison of 825 spaceflight multiomics DEGs to the 629 significant DEGs (Spaceflight vs Ground Control; p -value < 0.05) from the bulk RNAseq data of the same mice brains from the same NASA mission (RR-3), indicated 11 shared genes ( p -value = 0.01582549, hypergeometric distribution test; see Gene overlap test in Methods; Supplementary Data 4 ). Out of these 11 overlapping genes, only 2 genes (Gabra6, and Kctd16) showed the same directional change in both the datasets indicating that the majority of spaceflight effects are cell type-specific and emphasizing the need for cell-specific analysis of central nervous system responses to spaceflight. We also compared these 825 spaceflight DEGs with spaceflight DEGs reported in a total of 11 other datasets processed by NASA OSDR including mass spectrometry and RNA-seq data collected from different organs of BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice strains. This comparison revealed a total of 461 overlapping DEGs ( p -value < 0.05) across all the 11 datasets combined (refer to Supplementary Data 5 for a detailed list of overlapping genes and the resulting p -value from the hypergeometric distribution test performed for each dataset). ST provides a high-resolution mapping of gene expression changes to mouse brain regions To investigate spaceflight-induced CNS alterations at a spatial level, we performed ST analysis on the other brain hemispheres from 3 flight (F1, F2, F3) and 3 ground control mice (G1, G2, G3). We collected two coronal sections from each brain hemisphere containing hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, striatum, amygdala and corpus callosum. In total, we captured 14,630 genes across 29,770 spots after filtering and detected 10,884 UMIs/spot and 3755 genes/spot on average (Fig. 2F, G ; Supplementary Fig. 3A, B ) and found a high overall gene expression correlation between spaceflight and ground control tissue sections ( r = 0.99, p < 0.05; Fig. 2H ). Unsupervised clustering analysis of spot information identified 18 distinct spatial clusters (further referred as ST clusters) (Fig. 3A, B ; Supplementary Data 6 ), which presented a clear separation between the cortical top (ST cluster 1) and bottom layers (ST cluster 9), as well as other major structures, including hippocampus (with separation of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus in ST clusters 10, 8 and 11 respectively), thalamus (ST cluster 5), striatum (ST clusters 0, 14), hypothalamus (ST cluster 2), pituitary (anterior and posterior; ST cluster 2), corpus callosum (ST cluster 12) and cerebral peduncles (ST cluster 4) (Fig. 3C ). Key functions of the markers (Supplementary Data 7 ) that were shared by numerous ST clusters include neurogenesis, neuronal development, axonal growth and synaptogenesis, indicating that ST cluster analysis is dominated by neuronal gene expression.

D Significantly different pathways ( p < 0.05) between flight and ground control in ST cluster 9 (Cortical neurons, bottom layers). E Visualization of number of clusters identified by single-nuclei multiomics and their proportions in each ST cluster (x-axis; 0–17). Only multiomics clusters with higher proportions (>10%) are displayed in the barplot. F Cell type proportions mapped to spatial coordinates on three ground control (top row) and three flight (bottom row) mouse brain sections (Synaptic transmission I or multiomics cluster 1; Myelination or multiomics cluster 3; Neuronal activity, Synaptic transmission III or multiomics cluster 15). Next, we investigated how spaceflight influences gene expression at the spatial level and identified a total of 4057 DEGs in 7 out of 18 ST clusters (Supplementary Data 8 ). The majority of DEGs were involved in neuronal development, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration, including 21 DEGs in hippocampal CA3 neurons. The most pronounced change in gene expression due to spaceflight was observed in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) which showed 3208 DEGs (1808 upregulated, and 1400 downregulated) with similar functions related to neuronal development and synaptic transmission in somatosensory, motor and visual cortex. Consensus pathway analysis 18 highlighted neurodegeneration-associated pathways in cortical neurons (bottom layers; ST cluster 9) including protein misfolding and abnormal protein clearance, indicating potential similarities with neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein misfolding and accumulation, such as Parkinson’s disease 19 , 20 (Fig. 3D ). Integration of multiomics and ST datasets for spatial and cell type-level effects of spaceflight To infer the spatial distribution of the clusters identified by multiomics, we performed spot deconvolution analysis on matching ST dataset using Stereoscope 21 (which corrects for biases arising from different experimental techniques before calculating celltype proportions probabilities) (Fig. 3E ; refer to Supplementary Figs. 4 – 6 for detailed visualizations of multiomics cluster proportions in ST dataset). The deconvolution analysis revealed similarities based on the assigned functional annotations between several multiomics and spatial data clusters, for instance, synaptic transmission (multiomics cluster 1 matched with ST clusters 0 and 2), myelination (multiomics cluster 3 matched ST clusters 4 and 12), and neuronal activity (multiomics cluster 15 matched ST cluster 5) (Fig. 3F ; Supplementary Figs. 7 , 8 ; Supplementary Data 9 ). This comparative analysis suggested the effects of spaceflight on synaptic transmission specifically in cortex (including both neurons and astrocytes, as revealed by snRNA-seq data that allowed cell type separation) and on dopaminergic neuron development specifically in striatum (Supplementary Data 9 ). Ligand-receptor interaction analysis suggests spaceflight-mediated effects on astrocyte functions To assess the effects of spaceflight on the cell-cell interaction level, we performed a ligand-receptor analysis on two multiomics clusters that showed among highest number of differentially expressed genes in response to spaceflight, i.e., multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes), and 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). We found 4 significantly upregulated interactions (Fig. 4A ), including adhesion molecule pairs, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) pairs, and VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor). These ligand-receptor interactions have previously been shown to be involved in cellular development in the CNS. EGFR 22 , is involved in neuronal development, including axonal outgrowth. Meanwhile, VEGFA 23 , 24 primarily regulates angiogenesis though it can also play a role in hippocampal neurogenesis, and astrocyte-produced VEGFA has previously been demonstrated to regulate neuronal NMDA receptor activity 23 – 25 . Interestingly, we found that spaceflight widely increased VEGFA_GRIN28 interactions between multiomics cluster pairs related to astrocytes and synaptic transmission, i.e., 4-11 (Astrocytes-GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). No ligand-receptor interactions in these clusters were significantly downregulated. Fig. 4. Ligand-receptor interactions, motif accessibility, and signaling pathways affected by spaceflight. Open in a new tab A Dotplot showing the differentially expressed ligand receptor pairs found by CellPhoneDB between two interacting multiomics clusters (4 and 11) which are affected by spaceflight. These clusters showed the largest number of spaceflight DEGs, and four LR pairs were found significantly upregulated in these interactions. The null distribution of the mean expression of the LR pairs was estimated by employing a random permutation approach. The mean expression of the interacting LR molecule pairs are indicated by the dot colors and the dot sizes represent the p -values which refers to the enrichment of the LR pair in the interacting multiomics clusters. Scales for both dot size and color are presented below the plot. B Accessibility differences for motifs Atoh1, Zic1, and Zic2 in multiomics cluster 4 of flight mice and ground control mice. Spaceflight results in reduced accessibility of these motifs in flight samples. Two-sided Chi-square test statistic was used for differential testing with FDR correction (fdr <0.05). C Accessibility differences for motifs Pou5f1, and Sox2 in multiomics cluster 11 of flight and ground control mice. Spaceflight results in increased accessibility of these motifs in flight samples.

D (left) adjusted p -value of differential interactions found by MISTy in intraview (cell type and pathway activity colocalization) occuring only in flight (blue; n = 3 individual ST flight mouse samples) or in controls (red; n = 3 individual ST ground control mouse samples), tiles with black border identify statistically significant changes, (middle) correlation of MAPK pathway activity and Neurovasculature abundance, and mapped on Visium slide for two samples (right). Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the differential interactions.

Two-sided Student’s t tests with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction was used to determine the differential interactions.

The boxplots in D , F , and G show the median as a central line, the box boundaries denote the first and third quartiles and the whiskers extend to the most extreme point in the range within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the box. We also extended the ligand-receptor analysis to the ST dataset using SpatialDM 26 . We applied SpatialDM on each ST brain section to identify spatially co-expressed LR pairs and found a total of 1260 LR pairs (Supplementary Fig. 9 ; refer to Supplementary Data 10 for a detailed list of LR pairs with corresponding z-scores across each ST section). Differential testing between the two conditions (flight and ground control) for the observed 1260 LR pairs revealed a total of 134 differential LR pairs (differential p -value < 0.1; Supplementary Data 11 ). Motif analysis shows spaceflight effects on transcription factor (TF) activity To investigate the effects of spaceflight on transcription factors (TFs), we performed motif analysis on snATAC-seq peaks from the single nucleus multiomics data, which revealed spaceflight-mediated differences in TF activity in several multiomics clusters (Supplementary Data 12 ), especially 4 (Astrocytes), and 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission). Spaceflight was associated with reduced accessibility of motifs Zic1, Zic2 and Atoh1 in multiomics clusters 4 (Astrocytes) 27 , 28 (Fig. 4B ). Meanwhile, increased accessibility of motifs Pou5f1 and Sox2 in multiomics cluster 11 (GABAergic Synaptic Transmission) might indicate reduced neuronal differentiation in spaceflight 29 – 31 (Fig. 4C ). In addition to neuronal effects, motifs Pparg, Rxra and Nr2f6, which collectively inhibit immune responses, showed decreased accessibility in telencephalon interneurons (multiomics cluster 11), suggesting increased inflammatory responses in space 32 – 34 , and possible circadian dysregulation 35 – 39 . Spatial gene expression patterns show several changes in signaling pathways occurring in spaceflight brain samples Local environments of cell types may affect the functional responses to spaceflight represented by changes in signaling pathways. We compared key signaling pathways in adjacent locations based on the spatially-resolved cell type deconvolution results from Stereoscope analyzed using the Multiview intercellular SpaTial modeling framework (MISTy) 40 . This tool allowed us to investigate the relationships between cell type proportions in each ST spot and activities of 14 pathways inferred by decoupler-py and PROGENy 41 , 42 . Specifically, the MISTy models predict cell type abundance in a spot based on an intraview (features in the same spot) and paraview (weighted sum of the features in the neighboring spots; weights decreasing with distance). Either cell type abundances or pathway activities were selected as “features” for the model, and a separate model was built for each sample and cell type. To analyze the effects of spaceflight, the models were subsequently aggregated into flight and ground control groups. Based on cell type abundances, we did not find any significant changes in cell type colocalization (which would occur during tissue restructuring or lesion formation) between flight and ground controls, similar to our previous finding of no significant changes in cell type abundance in deconvolution results (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8 ). In contrast, changes in signaling pathways were associated with individual cell types. Cell abundance in neurovasculature (multiomics cluster 12) colocalized with decreased MAPK signaling in spaceflight (Fig. 4D ). Similarly, signaling changes in local neighborhood (MISTy paraview) of several other cell types were found in spaceflight samples (Fig. 4E ): (1) less negative correlation of EGFR signaling and glutamatergic neuronal cells; (2) more negative correlation of MAPK and cholinergic, monoaminergic and peptidergic neurons; (3) increased TGFbeta signaling in the vicinity of GABAergic interneurons; (4) reduced WNT signaling in class II glutamatergic neurons. To assess the downstream effects of these changes, we built a tissue-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) from the multiomics data using CellOracle 43 and used it to predict TF activities in spatial data and computed the Pearson correlation between TF and signaling activities for the dysregulated pathways in spots containing the cell types identified above. The network suggested that the decrease in MAPK signaling in spaceflight increases activity of the transcription factor Glis3 and reduces Lef1 in neurovasculature, respectively (Fig. 4F, G ). Metabolic gene enrichment analysis shows decreased gene expression in spaceflight mice Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the ST data using metabolic pathways indicated spaceflight-mediated inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, especially Complex I signaling (Fig. 5A , Supplementary Data 13 ), as well as pathways related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 10 ), fructose and mannose metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 11 ) and arachidonic acid metabolism (Fig. 5B ). Analysis of multiomics data was consistent with spaceflight-mediated reduction in these pathways together with fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 5C ; Supplementary Data 14 ). Deficits in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation are consistent with previously reported mitochondrial impairments caused by spaceflight 44 , while, arachidonic acid is primarily produced by astrocytes and suggests astrocyte dysfunction as a potential target for future spaceflight CNS studies.

Validation of differential gene expression In order to validate our findings on the spaceflight affected processes in mouse brain, we performed single molecule Fluorescence In situ Hybridization (smFISH) using the RNAscope technology for two genes of interest (Adcy1 and Gpc5) in five brain sections: 3 flights, 2 ground controls (Supplementary Fig. 12 ) from a comparative set of mice (see Methods). We observed significant upregulation in the expression of both genes in spaceflight samples, confirming our findings from the ST data and multiomics data analysis (Supplementary Data 3 and 8 , Supplementary Fig. 13A–C ). Adcy1 was particularly upregulated in the hippocampus and associated with changes in neuronal activity (ST clusters 8, 11), while Gpc5 was upregulated in astrocytes (multiomics cluster 4).",
    "Conclusion": "In this study, we used brain samples from ground control and spaceflown female mice from the RR-3 mission to understand the effects of the space environment at high resolution: at the level of individual brain cell types and brain regions. The main alterations in gene expression induced by spaceflight included changes in synaptogenesis and neuronal development, as well as neurodegeneration and inflammation, similar to previously reported tissue and behavioral-level effects of simulated spaceflight and simulated deep space radiation in mice 12 . In addition, multiple gene expression changes mapped to pathways associated with circadian rhythm and mitochondrial functions. This study applies spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multiomics to study the effects of spaceflight on the CNS which can serve as a stepping stone towards comparative investigation of samples from other space missions and the outcomes of live animal return and reacclimation to Earth conditions. We demonstrate spatial transcriptomics and single nuclei multiomics datasets to be highly complementary. For example, single-nucleus resolution permitted a focus on glial cells including astrocytes and microglia, which were not distinguishable in neuron-dominated ST datasets, due to the lower resolution of the method. Similarly, our snATAC-seq analysis in transcription factor binding sites indicated immune dysfunction 34 , while immune cells were too few to be distinguishable in ST. On the other hand, combining spatial and gene expression data revealed region-specific effects of spaceflight 32 , 45 . Furthermore, analysis of ligand-receptor interactions revealed interactions between different cell types, with the focus on neurodevelopment and astrocyte functions. In our study, multiple lines of evidence converged on spaceflight-mediated disruption of neurogenesis, neuronal development and synaptogenesis, including dopaminergic synapse formation in the striatum. Similar outcomes of increased pluripotency and reduced cell differentiation have previously been reported in spaceflown mouse bone samples 46 , in spaceflown human stem cell models 47 , and in irradiated mouse models 48 , indicating that it might be a systemic impairment that has now been identified to include the CNS. In addition, neurogenesis has been shown to be affected in a spaceflight analog study that combined simulated microgravity and low dose rate photon irradiation in mice 10 . Notably, synaptogenesis is particularly sensitive to simulated galactic cosmic radiation components 49 , indicating a potential additional risk for deep space missions. Finally, our observations in the striatal gene expression changes and transcription factor accessibility are worth validating in future spaceflight experiments, since they might result in disrupted dopaminergic signaling. Spaceflight-associated changes in circadian gene expression are consistent with circadian disruption as one of the major biological responses to spaceflight 50 , though it has been studied comparatively little so far, especially in animal models 51 . Molecular and cellular CNS correlation of circadian gene expression dysregulation in spaceflight remains to be investigated in greater detail. Our results suggest potential similarities between spaceflight and some terrestrial CNS conditions. Changes in gene expression associated with disrupted synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammation collectively resemble neurodegeneration that is associated with natural aging. Thus, in future studies anti-aging and neuroprotective therapeutics, such as antioxidants 52 or mitochondria-targeting pharmaceuticals 53 , 54 , might be repurposed as spaceflight countermeasures, or vice versa, spaceflight might be used as a model for accelerated aging 55 . We have recently begun computational studies on identifying terrestrial disorder analogs to alterations induced by spaceflight, though they have not yet included CNS effects, which will require comparing the data from multiple spaceflight experiments 56 . Our study presents two main limitations. The first one is related to statistical robustness. Specifically, since the input material consists of spaceflight legacy samples collected without envisioning a spatial transcriptomics analysis, the resulting brain morphology is not fully even across samples. This limits the interpretability of the differences between spaceflight and ground control conditions to only a subset of spatial and multiomics clusters. Therefore, it will be important to validate the results of the RR-3 mission by comparing them to the neuronal effects of spaceflight in other mouse studies at similarly high resolution to increase statistical robustness. Moreover, it will be meaningful to expand the experimental design by including samples from animals that underwent a period of reacclimation to ground conditions after spaceflight. By doing so, it will be possible to quantify the extent to which spaceflight-mediated impairments persist after landing, especially once model organisms begin to age. This will allow the investigation of key aspects of astronaut health risks that have not been included yet. The second limitation of our study relates to the sex of the analyzed animals. The majority of mouse studies in spaceflight have been performed on females to facilitate group housing, while astronaut cohorts include both male and female astronauts. Thus, it will be necessary to compare male and female animals to address the sexual dimorphism of CNS health risks. In order to further extrapolate animal models to human outcomes, human and mouse CNS organ model systems will have to be flown as payloads. The first human neurovascular models have already been investigated on the ISS 57 , 58 , though their results have not yet been published, while analyzing the effects of simulated space radiation on human neurovascular models 59 highlighted the importance of investigating astrocyte functions in missions beyond low-Earth orbit. In preparation for these missions, in which crew time will be severely limited, it will be essential to develop automated, long-lasting CNS models and compare their responses to model organisms. Overall, our study serves as a preliminary indication to the potential risks that the brain is exposed to in spaceflight missions and more studies with larger sample sizes will be required to confirm our findings. To encourage the scientific community to use our datasets for generating new discoveries, all our data is openly available through NASA GeneLab and can be explored by a Shiny app ( https://giacomellolabst.shinyapps.io/rr3-brain-shiny/ ). In summary, in this study, we observed that spaceflight altered the expression of genes associated with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal development in multiple regions of the brain, especially striatum, as well as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation collectively resembling neurological aging and neurodegeneration. Future studies are planned to increase statistical robustness, focus on neuroimmune outcomes and investigate the persistence of spaceflight effects after landing and re-acclimation to Earth environment. In addition, our findings illustrate the benefits of combined spatial transcriptomics and single-cell analysis in revealing detailed biological alterations and suggest them as highly relevant techniques for future space biology research. Our shared data, freely available in NASA’s OSDR database 60 , aims to deepen our collective understanding of the impact of spaceflight on biological systems.",
