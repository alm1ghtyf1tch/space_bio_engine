    "Abstract": "Abstract Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.

    "Results": "2.1. Establishment of Microgravity Mouse Model Based on 3D-Clinostat We established a microgravity animal model for C57BL/6 mice using a 3D-Clinostat ( Figure 1 a), with Video S1 showing the operation of the clinostat and Figure S1a demonstrating the design drawing of the mouse survival box. During the 42-day experimental period, we measured the daily food and water intake of the mice in both groups and found that the rotation treatment did not affect the mice’s consumption of food and water ( Figure 1 b). To evaluate the impact of simulated microgravity on the growth and development of mice, we monitored their body weight throughout the treatment period. We observed that compared to the wild type (WT) group, the body weight of mice in the simulated microgravity (SMG) group showed a declining trend from Day 0 to Day 7, then gradually returned to normal growth, and stabilized after Day 21 ( Figure S1b ). Statistical analysis of the body weight differences between the two groups on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21 revealed that the body weight of the SMG group was significantly lower than that of the WT group on Days 7, 14, and 21 ( Figure 1 b). This suggests that the 3D-Clinostat treatment may have caused damage to the mice, leading to a decrease in body weight. Although the mice gradually adapted and returned to normal growth after Day 7, there was still a difference compared to the WT group. Furthermore, on Day 42, we performed autopsies on the mice and analyzed their main organ indices, finding no significant change in the heart index but a significant decrease in the liver, spleen, and thymus indices, indicating that the 3D-Clinostat treatment may have affected the mice’s digestive and immune systems ( Figure 1 b).

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus WT group. To determine whether the damage caused by the 3D-Clinostat treatment was due to simulated microgravity, we investigated the osteoporosis condition of the mice’s hindlimb femurs. Osteoporosis is a characteristic effect of the body under microgravity stress, and therefore, changes in femur-related indices can be used as a basis for judging the effectiveness of the microgravity simulation [ 38 , 39 ]. First, we examined the femur index, femur length, and femur diameter of the mice’s hindlimb right femur and found no significant differences after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat ( Figure S2 ). Then, we used Micro-CT and HE staining to assess the morphological structure of the mouse femur. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse femur from Micro-CT images showed that the number of trabeculae in the femur tissue was significantly reduced after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat, with sparse arrangement and even fractures, wider trabecular spacing, and increased separation ( Figure 1 c). HE staining for the morphological examination of the bone tissue of the right hindlimb femur revealed that in the WT group, the trabeculae were clear, evenly distributed, neatly arranged, with a larger thickness and smaller spacing, closely linked, and the marrow cavity was clear with a relatively intact structure ( Figure 1 c). In contrast, the model group mice showed significantly thinner and narrower trabeculae, with increased spacing, loose and incomplete arrangement, and areas of trabecular loss. Furthermore, we measured the microstructural parameters of the cancellous bone and found that after treatment with the 3D-Clinostat, the BV/TV (bone volume fraction), Tb. N (trabecular number), Tb. Th (trabecular thickness), and Ct. Th (cortical thickness) were significantly decreased, while the Tb. Sp (trabecular separation) and trabecular bone pattern factor significantly increased ( Figure 1 d). These findings collectively indicate that the mice’s femurs exhibited a significant state of osteoporosis, suggesting the successful establishment of the microgravity mouse model. 2.2. Microgravity-Induced Imbalance in Mouse Gut Microbiota Microgravity, as an environmental stressor in spaceflight, induces physiological changes including alterations in the intestinal tissue and gut microbiota [ 40 ]. Through HE staining of colonic tissue, we observed that simulated microgravity (SMG) caused damage to the colonic lumen, characterized by thinning of the epithelium, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced crypt damage ( Figure 2 a). We also observed that the feces of the SMG-treated mice were softer and more yellowish, whereas those of the WT group were normal, dark brown, and granular, with a moderate texture ( Figure 2 b). The differences in fecal status indicated gastrointestinal dysfunction and poor food digestion and absorption in the SMG-treated mice. Concurrent with the colonic tissue damage, we found a significant increase in the secretion of intestinal cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in SMG-treated mice ( Figure 2 c). Changes in the intestinal physiological environment led to alterations in the gut microbiota. To investigate whether microgravity restructured the mouse gut microbiota, we analyzed and compared the diversity differences between SMG and WT groups, including α-diversity and β-diversity indices. Among the α-diversity indices, the Shannon and Simpson indices decreased in the SMG group compared to the WT group ( p < 0.05) ( Figure 2 d,e). Analysis methods for β-diversity, including unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA, Figure 2 f), Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Figure 2 g), and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA, Figure 2 h), were employed to study the similarities or differences in sample community composition. We found that samples from the SMG group clustered together, distinct from those of the WT group, regardless of the β-diversity analysis method used. Additionally, by statistically analyzing the number of significantly different microorganisms at various taxonomic levels between SMG and WT groups ( Figure 2 i), we identified 6 significantly different phyla ( Firmicutes , Acidobacteria , Actinobacteria , Verrucomicrobia , Bacteroidetes , and Deferribacteres , Figure S3a ), 7 significantly different classes, including Bacilli , Acidobacteria , Deferribacteres , Deltaproteobacteria , Bacteroidia , Actinobacteria , and Verrucomicrobia ( Figure S3b ), as well as 7 significantly different orders ( Figure S3c ), 15 significantly different families ( Figure S3d ), and 26 significantly different genera ( Figure S3e ).

Microgravity-Induced Dysbiosis Leads to Metabolic Imbalance in Liver and Brain The composition of the mouse gut microbiota is closely related to its function, and local intestinal functional changes may affect the host’s physiology [ 41 ]. To explore the functional characteristics of the gut microbiota after microgravity restructuring, we focused on the KEGG predictions involving cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, and metabolism. We found that the functional differences in the gut microbiota were mainly enriched in 49 related pathways of metabolic functions and 14 related pathways of organismal system functions ( Figure 3 a). To more intuitively discover the significance of the altered metabolic pathways, we focused on the changed pathway enrichment in the metabolism and organismal systems at KEGG level 2. The study found that secondary pathways related to metabolic functions mainly involved lipid metabolism and the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites ( Figure 3 b). Those related to organismal system functions primarily concerned digestive system metabolism, the nervous system, and the endocrine system ( Figure 3 c). Furthermore, tertiary pathways involved in lipid metabolism included glycerolipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and fatty acid degradation ( Figure 3 d). Tertiary pathways related to the digestive system included mineral absorption, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, pancreatic secretion, and salivary secretion ( Figure 3 e). Pathways involved in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites included tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, carbapenem biosynthesis, and phenazine biosynthesis ( Figure 3 f). Pathways related to the nervous and endocrine systems included the glucagon signaling pathway, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, estrogen signaling pathway, and prolactin signaling pathway ( Figure 3 g). These results suggest that microgravity restructured the composition and function of the gut microbiota, causing damage to the host’s lipid metabolic functions and the health of the digestive system, including the gut and liver, as well as the nervous and endocrine systems involving the brain.

Replicability of Gut Microbiota in Mice Under Microgravity To further explore the replicability of gut microbiota, we used the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) technique to intragastrically administer the fecal suspension of mice in the SMG group to wild-type C57BL/6 mice, and this group was marked as FMT. The intestinal contents of this group were analyzed by 16S sequencing, and the microbiota structure was compared with those of the WT and SMG groups. We found that the α diversity (Shannon index and Simpson index) of the gut microbiota in the WT group mice was significantly different from that in the SMG group and the FMT group ( Figure 4 a,b). For β-diversity, it can also be seen from UPGMA ( Figure 4 c), PCA ( Figure 4 d), and PCoA ( Figure 4 e) that the WT group was significantly independent in spatial distance from the other two groups, while the gut microbiota diversity of the SMG group and the FMT group showed a highly overlapping state. By analyzing the microbiota structure among the three groups using Circos software (version 0.69-9), it was also found that the gut microbiota in the SMG and FMT groups were very similar in composition structure and were clearly distinguishable from the WT group ( Figure 4 f). Comparing the differences in the top 15 gut microbiota with relative abundances in mice under the three different treatment methods at the phylum, class, and order levels ( Figure 4 g–i), similar results were obtained. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of gut microbiota characteristics among FMT, SMG, and WT group mice. ( a , b ) Differences in α diversity: Shannon index ( a ) and Simpson index.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, ** p < 0.01. For the heatmap, red represents high abundance and blue represents low abundance. In addition, we counted the total number of microorganisms with significant differences at each taxonomic level between FMT and WT and identified 6 phyla, 7 classes, 8 orders, 16 families, and 38 genera with significant differences ( Figure 5 a). This was close to the number of microorganisms with significant differences obtained at each taxonomic level between SMG and WT. Furthermore, to analyze the gut microbiota related to the microgravity effect, we screened the common differential microbiota at each taxonomic level between the WT group and the SMG group as well as between the WT group and the FMT group. It was found that there were 5, 6, 6, 10, and 23 common differential bacteria at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels, respectively ( Figure 5 b–f). In Figure S4a–e , we showed the specific up-regulation and down-regulation trends of the common differential bacteria in the SMG and FMT groups compared with the WT group. We found that the up-regulation and down-regulation trends of each genus were consistent in the SMG group and the FMT group. These common differential genera between SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT may play an important role in the response of gut microbiota to microgravity stress. The above results indicate that FMT can reproduce the characteristics of gut microbiota under microgravity well, whether in terms of microbiota diversity, structure, differences at each taxonomic level, or up-regulation and down-regulation trends.

Microgravity Induces an Imbalance of Serum Metabolites in the Body Changes in the gut microbiota are closely related to nutrient absorption and metabolism, which can lead to alterations in a multitude of endogenous small molecule metabolites in the serum, including highly polar amino acids, glucose, nucleosides, as well as less polar lipids and sterols [ 42 ]. Monitoring these fluctuations in serum metabolites can provide insights into the biochemical activities within an organism, thereby assessing the stress response and health status under specific environmental conditions. To explore the reconstructive effects of microgravity on mouse serum metabolites, we employed LC–MS technology to analyze the metabolic profiles of the mice’s serum. To distinguish the differences in serum metabolites among the three groups, orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was conducted. All sample data points fell within the 95% confidence interval (CI). R2X and R2Y were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model construction, while Q2 reflected the predictive power of the model. The OPLS-DA model revealed distinct metabolic profiles among the three groups in both the ESI positive ion mode (SMG/WT: R2X = 0.692, R2Y = 0.997, Q2 = 0.803; FMT/WT: R2X = 0.536, R2Y = 0.997, Q2 = 0.765, Figure 6 a–e) and the negative ion mode (SMG/WT: R2X = 0.625, R2Y = 0.999, Q2 = 0.929; FMT/WT: R2X = 0.562, R2Y = 0.999, Q2 = 0.911, Figure 6 f–j).

( i , j ) The 200 replacement tests for SMG versus WT group and FMT versus WT group in the negative source model ( n = 6). Similar to the distribution of gut microbiota diversity, we observed that the serum metabolite profiles of the SMG group and the FMT group were essentially overlapping, while being significantly separated from the WT group. The similar microbial community characteristics and serum metabolic profiles between the SMG and FMT groups suggest that microgravity may alter the serum metabolic spectrum by restructuring the gut microbiota of the mice. This finding implies that the changes in the gut microbiota under microgravity conditions could be a key factor in the metabolic shifts observed in the serum, potentially leading to a better understanding of the physiological impacts of microgravity on the organism. 2.6. Microgravity-Induced Disruption of Serum Metabolites by the Gut Microbiota Leading to Hepatic and Cerebral Metabolic Disorders To explore the impact of microgravity-altered metabolic profiles on the organism, we further analyzed the significantly different metabolites (SDMs) and their functions. Based on the variable importance projection (VIP) being greater than 1 and a p -value less than 0.05, we identified 27 differentially upregulated metabolites and 68 differentially downregulated metabolites in the SMG group compared to the WT group. Similarly, 32 metabolites were increased, while 42 were decreased in the FMT group compared to the WT group ( Figure 7 a). To uncover the metabolites closely associated with the gut microbiota, we found 61 core SDMs that appeared in both the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT ( Figure 7 b,c). Using MetaboAnalyst 6.0, we classified these 61 core SDMs, with 56 being attributed to their respective subcategories. The top five categories of compounds by the number of SDMs were fatty acids and conjugates, accounting for 23.21% of the total, with 13 metabolites; amino acids, peptides, and analogs, representing 19.64%, with 11 metabolites; and fatty acid esters, making up 5.36%, with 3 metabolites ( Figure 7 d). This suggests that both the SMG and FMT groups exhibited evident disruptions in lipid and amino acid metabolism compared to the WT group. Figure 7.

( i ) Analysis of pathways jointly regulated by differential metabolites between SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT. For the heatmap, red represents high abundance and blue represents low abundance. To investigate the health effects of the metabolic disorders induced by microgravity, we performed KEGG functional enrichment analysis on the differential metabolites of the SMG group compared to the WT group. The top 20 pathways affected were primarily involved in metabolism, organismal systems, and environmental information processing. In terms of metabolism, 25 SDMs were involved in lipid metabolism, 7 in amino acid metabolism, and 5 in nucleotide metabolism. Regarding organismal systems, eight SDMs impacted the digestive system, and five affected the endocrine system. For environmental information processing, nine SDMs were involved in membrane transport, and three in signal transduction ( Figure 7 e). Similarly, we conducted KEGG functional enrichment analysis on the differential metabolites of the FMT group compared to the WT group, revealing that the top 20 pathways were also related to metabolism, organismal systems, and environmental information processing. In metabolism, 18 SDMs were involved in lipid metabolism, and 16 in amino acid metabolism. For organismal systems, 14 SDMs impacted the digestive system. In environmental information processing, 10 SDMs were involved in membrane transport, and 4 in signal transduction ( Figure 7 f). Furthermore, to explore the role of the gut microbiota in the physiological disorders induced by microgravity, we analyzed the common metabolic pathways involved by the SDMs (differential metabolites) of both the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT group, identifying 48 pathways ( Figure 7 g). Consistent with the predicted functional impacts of gut microbiota under microgravity, the shared metabolic pathways included lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism in metabolism; the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in organismal systems; and signal transduction and membrane transport in environmental information processing ( Figure 7 h). Tables S1 and S2 list the shared pathways for SMG vs. WT and FMT vs. WT, respectively. Additionally, we compared the 48 metabolic pathways involving 42 common SDMs between the SMG and FMT groups with those identified in the SMG and FMT groups, finding 42 shared pathways ( Figure 7 i, Table S3 ). Interestingly, these pathways were primarily involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism in metabolism, the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in organismal systems, and signal transduction and membrane transport in environmental information processing. This suggests that the imbalance of the gut microbiota under microgravity may lead to host lipid and neuroendocrine disorders, with the 61 common SDMs potentially playing a crucial role in these physiological responses. To elucidate the role of these 61 common differential metabolites in the main physiological effects induced by microgravity, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, digestive system, nervous system, endocrine system, membrane transport, and signal transduction, we performed technical analysis of their involvement in the metabolic pathways of interest. We found that several common differential metabolites (e.g., L-Glutamine, L-Leucine, Dodecanoic acid, etc.) were involved in the primary physiological effects triggered by microgravity ( Table S4 ). Based on these results, we hypothesize that the imbalance of the gut microbiota induced by microgravity may lead to significant changes in key serum metabolites, which in turn could cause hepatic and cerebral metabolic disorders. 2.7. Hepatic and Cerebral Metabolic Disorders Induced by Microgravity The findings from gut microbiota and serum metabolomics suggest that microgravity may cause an imbalance in the gut microbiota, leading to disruptions in amino acid and lipid metabolism, and potentially inducing functional damage to the digestive and endocrine systems. The liver, being the primary organ involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism within the digestive system, and the brain, as the central control hub of the nervous and endocrine systems, are of particular interest [ 43 , 44 ]. To verify the hypothesis that microgravity-induced restructuring of the gut microbiota could lead to metabolic disorders in the liver and brain, we examined the morphological structure of the liver and brain in the SMG, FMT, and WT groups of mice using HE staining and magnetic resonance imaging. In the pathological sections of mouse liver tissue and quantification the vesicular steatosis, we observed micro/macrovesicular steatosis (fatty liver), inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, more vacuole, and higher percentages of the hepatic parenchymal area occupied by vacuole in the SMG group ( Figure 8 a and Figure S5 ). The FMT group showed minor fatty degeneration, inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration, medium vacuole, and less higher percentages of the hepatic parenchymal area occupied by vacuole. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the brain revealed that the volumes of various brain regions, including the striatum, ventricles, and hippocampus, were expanded in the SMG and FMT groups compared to the WT group, although not significantly ( Figure 8 b,c). Furthermore, we assessed potential brain functional abnormalities using the Barnes maze and Y-maze. The Barnes maze was used to evaluate spatial memory in mice [ 45 ]. As shown in Figure 8 d, we categorized the paths of mice from all groups during the Barnes maze experiment (including the four days of training) into five characteristics. We observed that the distribution of latency times for mice in the SMG, FMT, and WT groups increased in the 90–120 s range, while those in the 0–30 s range decreased ( Figure 8 f). Scoring revealed that the SMG group had lower scores than the FMT, which in turn was lower than the WT ( Table S5 ). Additionally, a daily analysis of latency times during the Barnes maze experiment ( Figure 8 e) showed no significant differences in latency among the three groups during the first two days. However, on the third day, the SMG group’s time to find the goal hole was significantly longer than that of the WT group ( p < 0.05), with no significant difference between the FMT and WT groups. From the fourth to the fifth day, the escape latency of both the SMG and FMT groups was significantly higher than that of the WT group. Figure 8.

The data shown are presented as mean ± SD, n = 6. n.s, no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 versus WT group. The Y-maze was used to assess the working memory differences among the SMG, FMT, and WT groups. We found that the SMG group had significantly fewer spontaneous alternations compared to the WT group, indicating memory loss ( p < 0.001), and the FMT group showed a similar trend ( p < 0.05), suggesting that the gut microbiota may be involved in the cognitive dysfunction induced by microgravity ( Figure 8 g). Subsequently, we also examined the antioxidant capacity and neurotransmitter levels in the brain tissue of the SMG, FMT, and WT groups and found that the T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, Glu, ACH, DOPA, 5-HT, and NE levels in the brain tissue of the WT group were significantly higher than those in the microgravity and FMT groups, while MDA and GABA levels were significantly lower ( Figure 9 b,e). The antioxidant capacity data in liver tissue also indicated that the T-AOC, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels in the liver tissue of the WT group were significantly higher than those in the microgravity and FMT groups, while MDA, ALT, and AST showed opposite results ( Figure 9 a,c,d). Serum tests also revealed that the levels of AST, ALT, TC, TG, and LDL in the WT group were significantly lower than in the other two groups, with HDL being significantly higher ( Figure 10 a). Additionally, the levels of cortisol and ACTH (cortisol and adrenocortic hormone) in serum were on average lower in the other two groups. Notably, the level of corticosterone, although not significantly elevated in the FMT group as with microgravity treatment, still showed a certain increase, suggesting neuroendocrine disorders in the SMG and FMT groups ( Figure 10 b). These results collectively suggest that microgravity may induce metabolic disorders in the liver and brain through the imbalance of the gut microbiota, leading to oxidative stress and further promoting structural or functional damage to the liver and brain.

    "Conclusion": "The complex environment of space, including strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures and microgravity, can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [ 46 , 47 ]. During medium- and long-term spaceflight, abnormal changes in multiple systems such as the liver and brain of astronauts, as well as in the neuro–endocrine–immune regulatory network, are the key and difficult points in spaceflight-related research. Although increasing evidence suggests that microgravity is involved in the abnormal changes in the liver and brain after spaceflight, the specific pathways through which it induces these abnormalities remain unclear. Establishing appropriate models is very important for solving this problem. To avoid the impact of unnecessary mechanical injuries on the results, in this study, we established a microgravity model of mice using the 3D-Clinostat and confirmed the feasibility of the new model through the commonly used evaluation methods of previous ground-based models. During the establishment of the new model, the daily food and water intake, which did not show significant changes, indicated that the physiological state of the mice was affected by environmental stress rather than diet. This environmental stress effect was very similar to the stress effect under real microgravity, suggesting that to some extent it was worthy of being a choice for ground-based simulation experiments. Obvious stress effects, such as weight loss, decreased organ indices, and bone loss, are common clinical manifestations of the microgravity effects in the head-down bed rest experiment (for humans) and the tail suspension experiment (for mice) [ 48 , 49 , 50 ]. Furthermore, we separately explored the impact of microgravity, one of the space environmental factors, on the liver and brain tissues of mice. The serum metabolome results, serving as macroscopic manifestations and preliminary diagnostic bases for the body’s condition, revealed obvious disorders in lipid and amino acid metabolism, as well as abnormalities in the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in the model group mice compared to the WT group. The excessively high levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), TC (total cholesterol), TG (triglyceride), LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and the overly low level of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) in the serum confirmed that the model group mice had clinical symptoms of disorders in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Similar to our results, increases in the levels of AST and ALT were also observed in the ground-based experiments on tail-suspended rats for 2 months and 42 days [ 21 , 51 ]. Likewise, during missions on the International Space Station, increases in TC, TG, and LDL in human serum were also observed, along with a decrease in the HDL level [ 16 ]. It can be seen that spaceflight has a serious impact on the body’s lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, and our results also prove that the single factor of microgravity also promotes such metabolic disorders, which may cause varying degrees of harm to the body’s systems. Metabolic disorders and abnormalities in the digestive system are closely related to the liver. In this study, the livers of the model group mice showed diffuse microvesicular/macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as abnormalities in antioxidant indicators such as T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase). These changes also frequently appeared in previous studies. Japanese quails that stayed on the Mir orbital station for five days showed a large number of lipid droplet depositions in almost all liver cells of all the flight chicks, and the total amount of lipid droplets was nearly five times higher than that of the ground control chicks [ 52 ]. Meanwhile, the accumulation of lipids in the liver led to the consumption of adipocytes in the bone marrow of these flight chicks. Abnormal lipid accumulation was also observed in the livers of all spaceflight mice as measured by Oil Red O staining [ 53 ]. In multiple spaceflight missions involving mice and rats, the liver system also exhibited varying degrees of lipid deposition, degeneration, and inflammatory damage [ 20 , 53 ]. In the ground-based experiment on 42-day head-down bed rest (HDBR) monkeys, compared with the WT group, the HDBR group monkeys also showed slight liver damage, with fatty vacuoles and inflammatory cell aggregation appearing in the liver [ 54 ]. The above results indicate that both spaceflight and the single factor of microgravity can lead to liver dysfunction, cause changes in lipid metabolism, and induce clinical features similar to those of early non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Besides abnormal liver metabolism and function, we also found abnormalities in the nervous system and endocrine system of the model group mice, which are directly related to the brain. In this study, the brain region structures of the model group mice, including the striatum, ventricles, and hippocampus, did not show significant changes. However, the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues (T-AOC, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, MDA) decreased. In the ground-based experiment of hindlimb suspension (HLS), the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the model group rats were significantly lower than those of the WT group [ 55 ]. Corresponding to the abnormal antioxidant function of the brain, the brain function of the model group mice was also affected, and their spatial memory and working memory were damaged to varying degrees. The memory ability of mice is closely related to the secretion of various neurotransmitters, especially Glu, ACH, 5-HT, DOPA, and NE. The impairment of memory ability may indicate that Glu is an amino acid neurotransmitter. It is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Moreover, Glu plays an important role in learning and memory, neuronal plasticity, and brain development [ 56 , 57 ]. ACH is a cholinergic neurotransmitter. They play an important role in regulating attention, enhancing learning and memory ability, and processing sensory information [ 58 , 59 ]. 5-HT, DA, and NE are monoamine neurotransmitters that can enhance the excitability of the brain and the ability of learning and memory [ 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 ]. 5-HT plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, and its receptor 5-HT1A regulates the neuronal cytoskeleton through the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, inducing neurogenesis and synapse formation [ 64 ]. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter. The reduction in dopamine content in the brain can lead to the loss, degeneration, or death of neurons, further impairing learning and memory [ 65 , 66 ]. NE has a very wide range of functions in the brain and is involved in the regulation of almost all brain functions, including learning and memory, attention, consciousness, alertness, and emotion. As expected, in our study, the secretion of several important neurotransmitters (Glu, ACH, DOPA, 5-HT, and NE) was abnormal, which might be the cause of the brain memory dysfunction. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the physiological disorders and pathological development of diseases in organisms are closely related to gut microbiota. Hundreds to thousands of kinds of bacteria colonize in the human intestine, and their quantity is so large that it far exceeds the number of human cells [ 67 ]. Gut microbiota mainly colonize in intestinal mucus, the intestinal lumen, and feces, and the number of genes they carry is more than 100 times that of human genes [ 68 ]. The changes in human physiological functions are closely associated with the intestinal microbial community. The mutually beneficial intestinal microbial ecology is of great importance for the homeostasis of metabolism and the liver–brain system [ 69 , 70 ]. Intestinal microorganisms play a role in metabolic regulation, intestinal peristalsis and barrier homeostasis, nutrient absorption, and neural signal transduction [ 71 ]. The relationship between the host and microorganisms is complex, and when an imbalance occurs, it may lead to abnormalities in the body’s systems. We have found that compared with the control group, the model group and the fecal microbiota transplantation group of mice exhibited gut physiological abnormalities (intestinal structure and tissue cytokines), fecal abnormalities, and gut microbiota imbalance under conditions of liver–brain metabolic disorders and functional abnormalities. The damage and inflammatory response in the colonic tissue of the SMG group mice suggest the disruption of the intestinal barrier and an abnormal physiological environment. This may directly affect the stability of the gut microbiota [ 72 ]. The group’s yellowish and soft feces further confirm this point [ 73 ]. Furthermore, we have discussed the common differential gut microbiota of the model group mice and the FMT group mice relative to the WT group. It was found that the imbalanced gut microbiota was found to be related to liver–brain abnormalities in functional prediction. This may be because microgravity affects the terminal metabolism of mice by reconstructing gut microbiota, thus inducing liver–brain abnormalities. Studies suggest that microgravity stress can change the physiological environment of the intestine and also have an impact on the virulence of intestinal bacteria and their resistance to antibiotics. Microgravity, low fluid shear, and microgravity-related dynamics have been proved to play a role in microbial gene expression, physiology, and pathogenesis [ 74 ]. Important intestinal bacterial metabolites such as valeric acid, indole-3-propionic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, indole, and equol play significant roles in the metabolism and functions of the intestine, liver, and brain. To explore how gut microbiota affects liver–brain abnormalities, we discussed the relationship between gut microbiota and significantly changed differential metabolites and analyzed the connection between typical differential metabolites and liver–brain abnormalities. The research results showed that the significantly decreased oleic acid is related to liver tissue health and lipid metabolism. 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota; valeric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota; adrenic acid is related to the secretion of neurotransmitters; L-glutamine is related to amino acid metabolism; and L-leucine is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. N(6)-Methyllysine is related to the brain and neurotransmitters. N-acetylglutamine is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. Glycyl-arginine is related to the brain, and m-chlorohippuric acid is related to the liver–brain and amino acid metabolism. Asymmetric dimethylarginine is related to the brain and nitrogen balance. Indole-3-propionic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Alpha-Hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-propanoic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Ketoleucine is related to the brain and nitrogen balance. Indole is a metabolite of gut microbiota. Equol is a metabolite of gut microbiota. As for the significantly increased ones, D-pipecolic acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid is related to the liver–brain system and amino acid metabolism. Salicylic acid is related to the liver. 3-hydroxybutyric acid is a metabolite of gut microbiota. 3-Methoxy-4-Hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate is related to the brain and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE). In order to explore the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress, this study used MetaMapp (version 2.0.1 45) to analyze the interactions between different metabolites and screen for key metabolites in the stress response of mice induced by microgravity at the metabolic level. MetaMapp is a tool for metabolomics data analysis and visualization. Its main function is to construct a network map of metabolites by integrating chemical similarity and mass spectral similarity matrices, as well as the KEGG reaction database [ 75 ]. It helps researchers map metabolomics data to biochemical modules, aiding biological interpretation. The network maps generated by MetaMapp clearly show the relationships and interactions among metabolites, which is very helpful for understanding complex metabolic networks. Moreover, MetaMapp does not rely on genomic information, allowing it to independently map and visualize metabolites. This makes it suitable for studying organisms without complete genomic information. As shown in Figure S6 , under the influence of microgravity, the interaction between amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism formed a large metabolic network. L-Leucine and ketoleucine were the key node metabolites connecting the interaction between amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. Specifically, L-Leucine linked amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism through N(6)-Methyllysine and L-Glutamine, while ketoleucine connected lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism through valeric acid. In addition, among the 61 common differential metabolites, we identified a series of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, including 2-Methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid, aleric acid, D-Pipecolic acid, Indole-3-propionic acid, alpha-Hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-propanoic acid, 3-Hydroxybutyric acid, indole, and equol. We hypothesized that these 12 metabolites play an important indicative role in revealing the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and the apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress. Furthermore, to briefly verify this hypothesis, we conducted Pearson correlation analyses among these 12 differential metabolites, differential metabolic bacterial genera, and significantly changed the physiological indicators of the liver and brain. The results showed a strong correlation in general ( Figure S7 ). Given that valeric acid is in a key position in the lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism network under microgravity stress and is also an important metabolite of the gut microbiota, connecting the differential bacterial genera, we speculate that microgravity stress causes the relevant bacterial genera to respond, leading to changes in the content of this compound in the intestine. This compound is absorbed into the blood through the intestine, causing changes in its content in the blood. Such changes, via the nodes, trigger abnormalities in metabolites related to neurotransmitter secretion and lipid metabolism in the amino acid metabolism or lipid metabolism network, further inducing metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. However, this speculation still requires further experimental verification. Finally, it is important to note that in our results, the FMT group did replicate some of the differences between the SMG and WT groups to a certain extent. However, there are still some differences between the FMT and WT groups, and even greater differences between the SMG and WT groups. This suggests that SMG treatment causes metabolic disorders in the liver and brain, which may involve gut microbiota imbalance, but also other mechanisms, including the following. (1) Impaired intestinal barrier function. Microgravity increases gut permeability, allowing bacteria and toxins to enter the bloodstream and trigger systemic inflammation [ 76 , 77 ]. The liver is particularly susceptible to this inflammation as it filters blood from the gut. Increased inflammation can impair liver function and lead to metabolic disorders. Tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells are crucial for maintaining gut barrier integrity, and microgravity may disrupt these junctions, further increasing gut permeability. This can lead to the translocation of bacteria and their products to the liver and brain, triggering inflammation and metabolic dysfunction [ 78 ]. (2) Inflammatory response. Microgravity can activate immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 79 ]. These cytokines can reach the liver and brain, triggering inflammation and impairing their functions [ 80 ]. Additionally, the chronic low-grade inflammation induced by microgravity can have a sustained negative impact on liver–brain metabolism. It can cause insulin resistance, fat accumulation, and oxidative stress, all of which promote the development of metabolic disorders. (3) Bile acid metabolism changes. Microgravity can affect bile acid synthesis in the liver [ 34 , 54 ]. Bile acids are crucial for fat digestion and absorption, and changes in their synthesis can lead to alterations in lipid metabolism, negatively affecting liver function and promoting the development of fatty liver disease. Bile acids also play a role in regulating signaling pathways related to liver–brain metabolism, and microgravity may disrupt these pathways, leading to metabolic dysfunction [ 81 ]. (4) Psychological factors. Microgravity can cause psychological stress and anxiety in astronauts [ 82 ]. These factors can negatively affect liver–brain metabolism [ 83 ]. Stress can lead to the release of stress hormones (such as cortisol), which can impair liver function and cause metabolic disorders. Anxiety can also affect brain function and lead to cognitive dysfunction.",
