    "Abstract": "Abstract Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens , have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.

Any comparisons that were not statistically significant are not reported. All figures with statistically significant results are indicated using brackets. Comparisons without brackets indicate a lack of statistically significant differences. 3.1. RH and Temperature Profiles The temperature and RH registered inside the PHABs ( Figure 5 ) shows a successful increase in temperature and humidity to promote fungal growth. The average temperature of incubation (activation to termination) was 24.8 ± 2.4 °C and 25.6 ± 0.9 °C for ground and spaceflight samples, respectively. The RH during incubation was 96.6 ± 6.0% for all spaceflight samples, while for Earth PHABs, the humidity was less stable for some cases. The average humidity on the ground was 56.1 ± 9.6%, 91.9 ± 5.9%, and 48.4 ± 16.9% for 10, 15, and 20 days of incubation, respectively. Figure 5.

Carbon Fiber No significant differences in P. rubens biofilm mass and thickness were observed when comparing incubation time and gravity conditions on carbon fiber. Nevertheless, there were two statistical differences in surface area coverage between gravity conditions. When grown for 10 days, biofilms formed in space had 22.7% less surface area coverage compared to samples grown on Earth ( p < 0.05). However, after 15 days of growth, the spaceflight samples had 37.8% more surface area coverage than the Earth controls ( p < 0.05) ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6.

Stainless Steel 316 There were no significant differences observed in P. rubens biofilm mass or thickness when compared throughout the gravity conditions and incubation times. Nevertheless, there were two statistical differences in surface area coverage under two comparisons. Biofilms formed on Earth showed differences between days 10 and 20, where the surface area coverage had an 85.8% decrease from day 10 to day 20 ( p < 0.05), as seen in Figure 7 a. Comparing between spaceflight and Earth, the only difference observed was on day 15, when the samples grown in space had a 30.7% increase in surface area coverage with respect to the 1 g controls ( p < 0.05); such an increase in microgravity was also noticeable in the microscopy images ( Figure 7 b,c).

Quartz There were no significant differences observed in mass or surface area coverage when comparing incubation times and gravity conditions of P. rubens biofilms grown on quartz. Nevertheless, biofilm thickness after 20 days had an 88.5% decrease compared to 15 days of incubation time in space conditions ( p < 0.05). When comparing the samples grown for 20 days, those grown in space had 58.8% less thickness compared to Earth samples ( p < 0.05), shown in Figure 8 . Figure 8.

Titanium Alloy The biofilm mass ( Figure 9 a) and thickness ( Figure 9 c), when grown for 20 days on Earth, showed a significant decrease compared to samples grown for 15 days with an 8% decrease in mass and a 52.8% decrease in thickness ( p < 0.05). Such a biofilm reduction (mass and thickness) was not observed in microgravity between 15 and 20 days. Surface area coverage ( Figure 9 b) of samples grown for 10 days on Earth was 4.6 times higher than those grown for 20 days under the same conditions ( p < 0.05). Significant changes between space and Earth samples were also observed in biofilm thickness. After 10 days of incubation, samples grown in space were 2.3 times thicker compared to samples on Earth ( p < 0.05). A similar observation was seen in the samples after 20 days, with samples grown in space being 1.97 times thicker compared to samples on Earth ( p < 0.05) ( Figure 9 c). Figure 9.

Silicone, MIT Nanograss, and Aluminum Alloy Biofilms grown on Silicone, Nanograss, and Aluminum Alloy presented no significant differences when compared by gravity and incubation time regarding biofilm mass, thickness, or surface area coverage. 3.8. Effect of Surface Material on Earth After 15 days growing in Earth conditions ( Figure 10 ), the biofilm surface area on silicone was 13% higher than the biofilm surface area on the Nanograss material ( p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in biofilm thickness and mass between materials. There were also no significant differences between materials in biofilm thickness, mass, and surface area for Earth samples grown for 10 and 20 days. Figure 10.

Space Samples after 15 Days Biofilm mass was significantly different between Nanograss and four other materials when grown in space for 15 days. Compared to the biofilm mass on Nanograss, 27-, 32-, and 30-fold increases in mass were observed on Stainless Steel, Quartz, and Titanium Alloy, respectively ( p < 0.05) ( Figure 12 a). Stainless Steel and Titanium Alloy not only had more biofilm mass than Nanograss, but also had 5% ( p < 0.01) and 4% ( p < 0.05) more biofilm surface area coverage, respectively ( Figure 12 b). There were no significant differences in biofilm thickness when grown in space conditions for 15 days. Figure 12.

    "Conclusion": "The primary aim of this investigation was to characterize P. rubens biofilm morphology on seven clinically or spaceflight relevant materials both in space and on Earth. All materials were susceptible to fungal biofilm formation, some more than others, regardless of the gravitational condition. The fungal samples had equivalent initial amounts of spores on all material substrates, as there were no significant differences in biomass after 6 h of incubation. Although the temperature was kept close to 25 °C during the incubation time across samples, and despite our efforts to provide a stable environment, the humidity presented significant variations. Specifically, the samples incubated for 10 and 20 days on Earth had RH of approximately half that of the rest of the conditions. Since each PHAB contained samples of all material coupons, this does not affect the comparisons across materials, but it could interfere with comparisons across incubation times and between gravitational regimes. 4.1. The Effect of Microgravity on Biofilm Growth One of the primary dependent variables examined was fungal biofilm formation in microgravity compared to Earth’s gravity. Three cases of significantly increased biofilm growth in microgravity were observed: Carbon Fiber at day 15 (surface area increase), Stainless Steel at day 15 (surface area increase), and Titanium Alloy at day 10 and day 20 (thickness increase). However, there were two cases that showed the contrary with significantly decreased biofilm growth in microgravity compared to Earth: Carbon Fiber at day 10 (surface area decrease) and Quartz at day 20 (thickness decrease). These two cases, where fungal biofilms on Earth grew better than in space, are of particular interest because those samples correspond to the conditions (Earth at 10 days and 20 days) that experienced fluctuations of humidity ( Figure 5 ). The ideal RH for P. chrysogenum is 90%, and decreases in fungal growth below this RH have been observed [ 39 ]. Previous studies have shown that drops in humidity can immediately stop growth and cause the dehydration of P. rubens [ 40 ]. On occasion, the fungus is able to start growing again when the humidity increases, but other times, RH fluctuations (of as little as 3 h) can suppress growth permanently, so only new germination can occur [ 40 ]. Additionally, there is evidence that after being exposed to high humidity, P. rubens cannot restart growth following a desiccation event of RH below 75% [ 41 ]. Since the humidity fluctuations in Earth PHABs of 10 and 20 days lasted for days and the PHABs reached RH of 50% and below, we expected the fungal growth to be impaired for those samples. Hence, it is possible that if RH values would have been equivalent between flight and ground in the day 10 and 20 PHABs, even more biofilm growth could have been observed on Earth. Nevertheless, this would not change our relative observation presented here—likely except for Titanium Alloy at 20 days, results that may be an artifact of the RH challenges. Quartz at 20 days was an exception to this trend as an increase in biofilm formation was seen despite lower RH values. While we have no clear explanation as to why this occurred, a previous study classified P. chrysogenum (the previous species name for P. rubens ) as xerotolerant, meaning it can undergo a complete life cycle at low RH values and is considered resistant to dry environments [ 42 ]. While this was not studied specifically in this investigation, how P. rubens survives in dry environments should be further examined. With that in mind, our results suggest mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth dependent on the material surface and without a clear trend in time. It is important to note the significant outlier in the Carbon Fiber 10-day sample grown on Earth and the effect of removing this outlier from the statistical test. When removed, the comparison between Earth and space sample groups is no longer significant; however, all of the other observed differences remain the same, which implies mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth. Despite the changes in biofilm growth in microgravity, no consistent visual trends in morphological shape (overall 3D structure) across gravity conditions were observed. Therefore, in our experiment, microgravity did not impact the fungal shape of the biofilm. The mechanisms behind the changes in fungal biofilm formation in microgravity are still unclear and need further investigation. One potential mechanism behind the changes observed in this investigation could lie in how different fungi sense gravity. The octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN) is the structural protein comprising the vacuolar protein crystals that the fungal family Mucorales uses to sense gravity [ 43 ]. While this protein does not exist in Penicillium species, other unknown gravity sensing proteins could be present. Research into how other fungal families, such as Penicillium, might be capable of sensing gravity is a crucial next step to understanding fungal biofilm growth in microgravity and the changes in biofilm formation observed in this study. 4.2. The Effect of Material Surface on Biofilm Growth After qualitative analysis of the fungal biofilms, no difference in biofilm shape was observed across materials ( Appendix B ). However, significant differences in mass, thickness, and surface area coverage of the biofilms between materials were identified. The Nanograss material was of particular interest in this investigation as a potential biofilm-resistant material. Nanograss was the most efficient material at reducing fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth. One potential explanation for the reduced biofilm formation is a reduced strength of adhesion. Spore adhesion was the same across all materials by 6 h time ( Appendix A ), meaning all spores were at minimum equivalently loosely adhered to the material surface. Adhesion strength, how strongly the fungi adheres to the material, and how much force the spores or biofilm can withstand before being removed are dependent on various material characteristics such as hydrophobicity, roughness, and charge [ 44 ]. Hydrophobicity is unlikely to be a factor contributing to the reduced biofilm growth. This is due to hydrophobins, which are proteins that help to determine a fungal spores’ hydrophobicity. One hydrophobin, RodA, has been shown to coat the outside of spores, forming a hydrophobic rodlet layer in Aspergillus fumigatus , and other hydrophobins have been identified in hyphae [ 45 , 46 , 47 ]. An ortholog RodA gene with 100% query cover (E value 0.0, and 90.40% identity) was found in P. rubens (Accession No. AM920436.1 ) using NCBI’s BLAST Tool, meaning that P. rubens could also have hydrophobic spores if this gene is being expressed. Nanograss is a highly hydrophobic material and therefore should allow the P. ruben spores to strongly adhere. Therefore, hydrophobicity is not the factor interfering with spore and hyphal adhesion preventing biofilm formation on Nanograss. Other factors such as surface roughness and charge are likely at play in preventing biofilm growth on Nanograss [ 44 ]. In the majority of previous research, P. rubens biofilms have been grown on gypsum, and data on the effect of roughness and surface charge on P. rubens biofilm formation are not available. Additionally, data on the roughness and charge of the materials used in this investigation are not available as these properties are manufacturer- and sometimes batch-dependent. Future experiments should measure this material’s properties to examine the effect of different material charges and roughness on biofilm growth on hydrophobic materials. Due to the decreased biofilm formation on Nanograss, this material warrants further studies with varying conditions and strains to determine its full potential as an anti-microbial material. 4.3. The Effect of Incubation Time on Biofilm Growth A decrease in biofilm growth was observed as incubation time increased in three cases: Titanium Alloy Earth samples (mass and thickness decreased between day 15 and day 20 and surface area decreased between day 10 and day 20), Quartz space samples (thickness decrease between day 15 and day 20), and Stainless Steel Earth samples (surface area decrease between day 10 and day 20). Since there was only a thin coat of PDB on the surface of the coupons, it is possible the nutrients were depleted as incubation time increased, causing the fungal biofilms to be in a starvation state. When in unfavorable conditions, small groups of fungal persister cells will form and remain even as other fungal cells die [ 48 ]. These cell populations have decreased metabolism and growth, allowing the biofilm to remain at a stable population level until conditions improve and growth can resume [ 49 ]. Furthermore, Candida albicans , another fungal species known for biofilm formation, can maintain a consistent population in starvation after an initial drop in cell population [ 50 ]. If the biofilms have depleted resources by day 15, a decrease in overall biofilm mass, thickness, and surface area can be expected as the cell population will start to die but maintains a minimum population with the assistance of persister cells. The reduced biofilms observed at day 20 could contain these persister cells, which would allow the biofilm to continue growth during a longer incubation time if the environment becomes favorable again, which could present a possible risk for future long-term missions. Further studies should be conducted to observe the effect of adding more nutrients to the fungal population after 20 days in microgravity. In the future, analyses of persister cells within the biofilm and their gene expression should be conducted, comparing the number of persister cells formed both in space and on Earth. This is especially relevant because the persister cells are more resistant to antimicrobials, and in confined spaces such as spacecraft, they could pose an increased health risk for astronauts. Another possibility for the decrease in biofilm formation on day 20 due to depleted nutrients is the weakening of cell–cell and cell–surface adhesions. Fungi have two types of adhesion proteins which are vital for cell–cell adhesion and cell–surface adhesion, lectin-like adhesions and sugar-independent adhesins [ 51 ]. Depleted nutrients decrease the amount of available sugars for the adhesins to bind to, potentially decreasing the strength of cell–surface adhesion. Whether the sugar-independent adhesions are sufficient to maintain a strong attachment is unknown and was not studied in this investigation. However, if the sugar-independent adhesions are insufficient, then fungi with a loose attachment were potentially washed away in the gentle washing steps during staining. Further studies should be conducted to determine if the depleted resources decreased the strength of biofilm adherence. Altogether, the results show that microgravity does not have a strong effect on biofilm shape and morphology of P. rubens up to 20 days of incubation. Even in the few cases where there was increased biofilm formation in microgravity, this effect was not maintained in time. Additionally, due to the reduced fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth, Nanograss could be considered as a potential anti-microbial material for certain spacecraft equipment. The results presented in this manuscript can contribute to the efforts of fungal biofilm control in space, but long-term tests (>20 days) as well as complementary transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are highly recommended, as microgravity effects were both material- and incubation-time-dependent.",
