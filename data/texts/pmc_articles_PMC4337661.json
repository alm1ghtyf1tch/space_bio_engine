    "Abstract": "Abstract Anthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone remains. This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone shaft second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e. I max / I min ). Individuals with high I max / I min values are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with μCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of I max and I min compared with controls, it failed to significantly increase the I max / I min index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading resulted in significantly diminished I max and I min compared with controls, but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased I max / I min compared with normal activity. Together, these results suggest that caution is required when the bone shaft bending strength index is used to reconstruct the activity levels of past humans.

    "Results": "Experiment 1: exercise Treatment with treadmill exercise resulted in significantly greater femoral mid-shaft I max ( P = 0.004) and I min ( P = 0.005) compared with sedentary controls (Fig. 1 ). However, exercise did not significantly alter the I max / I min bending strength index ( P = 0.74), indicating that the simulated high-activity lifestyle did not lead to more elliptically shaped femoral mid-shafts.

Bars equal the percent difference between the exercise mean relative to the control mean. Whiskers equal the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the relative difference.

Experiment 2: unloading In control animals, femoral mid-shaft I max and I min both increased significantly ( P < 0.0001) over the course of the experimental period (Fig. 2 ). By contrast, in animals subjected to hindlimb unloading, little change occurred in either I max ( P = 0.34) or I min ( P = 0.40). Stunted normal bone growth in the unloading group ultimately led to significantly ( P < 0.0001) diminished femoral mid-shaft I max and I min compared with controls. During the experiment, the I max / I min bending strength index decreased significantly and roughly equally in the control ( P = 0.007) and unloading groups ( P = 0.002), such that the simulated low-activity lifestyle did not result in greater femoral mid-shaft circularity compared with normal activity ( P = 0.64).

    "Conclusion": "Extrapolating experimental data from mice to humans requires caution given critical differences between species, including size, locomotor styles and bone tissue composition. Even so, mice are the experimental model of choice in most bone biology research for both logistical reasons and because the genes and molecules influencing the skeleton are highly conserved in mice and humans (Karsenty & Ferron, 2012 ). Furthermore, the skeletal reaction to alterations in mechanical environment is generally similar between species (Squire et al. 2004 ; Luu et al. 2009 ). If extrapolation of mouse data to humans is warranted, then the results of the two experiments presented here suggest that high- and low-activity lifestyles do not have the causal effects on the shaft bending strength index that are often assumed in anthropological analyses of human lower limb bone shaft structure (Ruff, 1987 ; Brock & Ruff, 1988 ; Larsen et al. 1995 ; Holt, 2003 ; Stock, 2006 ; Lieverse et al. 2011 ). The results of the first experiment are generally consistent with those of previous experiments involving animal models, as well as longitudinal studies involving humans, that measured the effects of exercise on the bone shaft bending strength index. Similar to our experiment, Lieberman et al. ( 2001 ) and Plochocki et al. ( 2008 ) treated sheep and mice, respectively, with a running regimen and documented significant exercise-related enlargements of hindlimb shaft I max and I min but no significant increase in the I max / I min index. In a prospective human study by Macdonald et al. ( 2009 ), in which growing boys engaged in a school-based exercise program comprised of jumping, skipping, dancing and playground circuits, positive change in tibial I max during the trial period was significantly greater in the exercise group compared with a control group, yet change in I max / I min was not significantly altered by exercise. Vainionpää et al. ( 2007 ) conducted a study in which adult women participated regularly in exercise sessions that included step patterns, stamping, jumping, running and walking. In both the femur and tibia, longitudinal changes in I max , I min and I max / I min were not significantly affected by exercise, perhaps reflecting the diminished responsiveness of the adult skeleton to loading. To our knowledge, no experimental or longitudinal study has ever documented a significant increase in limb bone shaft I max / I min resulting from engagement in an exercise regimen. The results of the second experiment are novel, and thus they are unlikely to be accepted outright without replication. Therefore, it is instructive to compare these results with those obtained from separate but similar experiments performed in our laboratory. In an unpublished study, we treated growing female mice with hindlimb unloading for 2 weeks starting at 9 weeks old and, consistent with our initial results, normal development of femoral I max and I min was found to be significantly retarded by unloading but the shaft bending strength index was not affected ( Fig. S1 ). In another study, skeletally mature adult male mice were tail-suspended for 2 weeks beginning at 28 weeks old, and instead of stunting normal bone growth, unloading led to significant loss of femoral I max and I min compared with morphological stasis among controls ( Fig. S2 ; see also Gupta et al. 2012 ). Yet, once again, the femoral shaft bending strength index was not altered by unloading. At present, all experimental data of which we are aware indicate that unloading does not lead to more circular shafts, regardless of whether it occurs early or later in life (but, see Lanyon, 1980 ). What evidence exists then for the link between physical activity level and the bone shaft bending strength index that is assumed in many anthropological analyses of human skeletal remains? Two types of indirect evidence are frequently cited. First, differences in the shaft bending strength index have been observed among living human populations with distinct activity patterns. For example, Shaw & Stock ( 2009 ) analyzed tibial mid-shaft shape among university cross-country runners, field hockey players and non-athletic controls, and found that, relative to both hockey players and controls, runners exhibited more elliptical shafts, primarily due to enhanced bending rigidity in the anteroposterior plane. The authors speculated that the elliptical shape of the runners' shafts was caused by the repetitive anteroposterior tibial loading that characterizes their training regimen, although this could not be demonstrated conclusively as this was a cross-sectional study and not a longitudinal study. Second, in anthropological studies of humans living in the past, changes in archaeological measures of settlement patterns that are concomitant with changes in the bone shaft bending strength index may suggest a connection between physical activity level and shaft shape. For example, Holt ( 2003 ) has shown that during the European Upper Paleolithic, femoral shafts became more circular at roughly the same time that changes in the archaeological record point to increasing population density and sedentism. Of these two types of indirect evidence, we find the former to be somewhat more persuasive as the activity patterns of living groups are actually known, while those of ancient populations are not. There are also two lines of direct evidence that are often cited to support the idea of a close relationship between physical activity level and the bone shaft bending strength index. First, the hypothesis that elliptically shaped bone shafts reflect high levels of physical activity is based on the premise that bone formation primarily takes place in the plane that bones engender peak mechanical stresses and strains; and the results of certain experiments with animal models in which in vivo strains were directly related to patterns of bone growth support this assumption. For example, peak magnitude strains have been associated with sites of increased bone formation in experiments involving external loading of rodent limbs (Mosley et al. 1997 ; Warden et al. 2004 ) and natural physiological limb loading in goats (Main, 2007 ). In contrast, however, other experiments involving weight-bearing exercise in chickens and sheep (Judex et al. 1997 ; Wallace et al. 2014 ) and exogenous limb loading in turkeys (Gross et al. 1997 ) found no significant associations between bone formation stimulated by loading and local strain magnitude. Ultimately, the disparity between results from different experiments suggests to us that a universal relationship between bone growth and local strain magnitude probably does not exist and, therefore, that loading cannot be assumed to have a predictable effect on shaft shape in every instance. Second, in the aforementioned longitudinal human study by Vainionpää et al. ( 2007 ), although engagement in the exercise regimen did not significantly alter the lower limb bone shaft bending strength index, across the entire study population (i.e. exercise participants and controls), weak but significant positive correlations were detected between the number of daily impacts (measured by accelerometer) and changes in femoral and tibial I max / I min throughout the course of the study. This is arguably the most compelling evidence for a causal relationship between physical activity level and human lower limb bone shaft shape. Nevertheless, until additional direct evidence is available from longitudinal and/or experimental studies, we suggest that much prudence is necessary when the shaft bending strength index is used to infer the activity levels of past humans.",
