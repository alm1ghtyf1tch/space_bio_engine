    "Abstract": "Abstract Little is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.

    "Results": "As expected from the F2 mouse population bred specifically for a large range in musculoskeletal mechanosensitivity, the response of both tissues to the two experimental regimes varied greatly across individuals. Body mass changes in these mice during unloading and reambulation[ 18 ] were not correlated with changes in any of the phenotype outcome variables (all R 2 <0.05). Unloading - Muscle During 3wk of unloading, muscle area (Mu.Ar) declined (p<0.001) on average by 9% (min: -26%, max: 9%) while in normally ambulating age-matched controls, Mu.Ar did not change significantly (mean: 2% min: -14%, max: 19%) over the same period ( Table 1 , Figure 2 ). The relative (net) mean difference of 11% (p<0.001) between the two groups was significant (i.e., mean loss in experimental mice during unloading was different from the non-significant mean gain in normal control mice). One QTL was identified on chromosome 5 for the loss in muscle cross-sectional area during unloading, explaining 5% (p<0.001) of the variability between mice ( Figure 3 ). Table 1.

Peaks crossing the black, red, green, and blue lines denote QTLs at significance thresholds of 63%, 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Reambulation - Muscle During reambulation, experimental mice averaged a 9% increase (p<0.001) in muscle area (min: -8% max: 31%), a change that was different (p<0.001) from the lack of growth in muscle area in age-matched controls (mean: 0%, min: -7%, max: 18%; Table 1 , Figure 2 ). In experimental mice, individuals that experienced the greatest losses in muscle area during unloading were moderately correlated with those that experienced the greatest gain during reambulation (R 2 =0.32, p<0.0001; Figure 4 ). Two suggestive QTLs for the gain of muscle area upon reambulation were identified on chromosomal loci that differed from QTL identified for unloading ( Figure 3 ). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Changes in muscle area during hindlimb unloading (HLU, horizontal axis) associated with changes in muscle area experienced during reambulation (RA, vertical axis). Unloading - Bone Unloading of the hindlimb reduced (p=0.04) cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis on average by 0.5% (min: -6%, max: 12%) while age matched controls gained 3% (p<0.001) over the same time period (min: 1%, max: 5%; Table 1 , Figure 2 ). Changes in the two groups were different from each other (p<0.001) with a net difference of 4%. Bone marrow area increased (p<0.001) on average by 6% (min: -12% max: 16%) during unloading, a response that was significantly different (p<0.001) from age matched controls in which Ma.Ar did not change significantly (min: -2%, max: 5%; Table 1 , Figure 2 ). Tissue mineral density increased (p=0.03) on average by 0.3% (min: -3%, max: 2%) during unloading, a smaller (p<0.001) increase than in age matched controls which gained 1% (p<0.001) over the same time period (min: 0%, max: 2%; Table 1 , Figure 2 ). For changes in cortical bone area, three QTLs on chromosomes 9, 18, and 19 were determined for unloading ( Figure 3 ), together accounting for 10% (p<0.001) of the variability in HLU induced change in Ct.Ar. QTLs responsible for the magnitude of change in bone marrow area during unloading were revealed on chromosomes 2 and 9, accounting for 10% (p<0.001) of the observed variability in this variable. No QTLs were found for changes in tissue mineral density during unloading. Reambulation - Bone During reambulation, increases in cortical area seen in experimental mice (mean: 4%, min: -1%, max: 9%, p<0.001) matched those of age matched controls (mean: 4%, min: 2%, max: 6%, p<0.001; Table 1 , Figure 2 ). During the reambulation period, marrow area decreased to a greater (p=0.04) degree in experimental mice (mean: -2%, min: -11%, max: 8%, p<0.001) than in controls (mean: -1%, min: -3%, max: 4%, p=0.05). The increase (p<0001) in tissue mineral density was 1% both in experimentals (min: -1%, max: 3%) and controls (min: 0%, max: 3%) during this time period without a significant between-group difference. Only weak correlations were found between unloading and reambulation for changes in any given variable; R 2 values for CT.Ar, Ma.Ar, and TMD amounted to 8%, 16%, and 7%, respectively (all p<0.0001). For reambulation and similar to muscle, no significant QTLs were identified for any of the three bone variables. For Ct.Ar, we found two suggestive QTLs (Chr 5 and 17) and for Ma.Ar, one suggested QTL was found (Chr 8) for reambulation ( Figure 3 ). Associations between muscle and bone Both during unloading and reambulation, those mice displaying the greatest changes in muscle area did not coincide with those that showed the greatest changes in cortical bone; associations between changes in muscle area and cortical area resulted in R 2 -values of less than 10% ( Figure 5 ). Coefficients of determination for changes in muscle area vs either marrow area or TMD were similarly low (data not shown). Extending the correlations between muscle and cortical bone to changes in trabecular bone previously reported from the metaphysis of the distal femur[ 18 ] produced similar results; R 2 -values for changes in muscle area versus changes in trabecular bone volume fraction yielded 11% for the unloading phase and less than 1% for the reambulation phase ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Associations between changes in muscle area vs cortical area (a. & c.) and changes in muscle area vs marrow area (b. & d.) for unloading (a. & b.) and reambulation (c. & d.). For unloading, the QTL for changes in muscle area on chromosome 5 did not overlap with those identified for cortical indices but shared common regions with previously determined trabecular QTLs from the same bones[ 18 ] for changes in three out of six trabecular indices; normalized bone surface, trabecular thickness, and trabecular tissue mineral density. For reambulation, the two suggestive QTLs for changes in muscle area on chromosomes 2 and 19 did not overlap with (suggestive) QTLs identified for cortical indices but with trabecular QTLs for changes in one out of six trabecular indices (trabecular number).",
    "Conclusion": "We tested for co-regulation between changes in muscle and bone during removal and reapplication of weightbearing activities with the rationale that if muscle size controls bone size, we should observe robust correlations in the response of the two tissues. In contrast to this hypothesis, the magnitude of the response of the two tissues to unloading and reambulation was not correlated across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population. This lack of coordination between muscle and bone at the tissue level was somewhat similar at the genetic level. The strong QTL for changes in muscle area during unloading on chromosome 5 did not overlap with any QTLs for changes in cortical bone properties but shared a common region for some trabecular properties. While these data emphasize the strong influence of genetic variations on the response of both skeletal muscle and bone, the low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response, are inconsistent with the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-regulates its size during mechanical challenges. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting results from this study. First, we did not measure changes in muscle strength but muscle cross-sectional area as a surrogate measure of strength is well accepted in clinical and animal studies[ 28 - 32 ]. Second, we chose the composite cross-sectional muscle area of several individual muscles as we assumed that the forces exerted by these muscles are primarily responsible for inducing bone strains in the diaphysis (and metaphysis) of the mouse femur and because the ÂµCT images did not allow for separation into distinct muscle groups. Third, we observed musculoskeletal changes in unloading and reambulation over a 3wk period each, a duration that significantly altered musculo-skeletal variables at the mouse femur during both unloading and reambulation but it is conceivable that time periods of different length would influence our results and conclusions. Using the initial adaptive changes in both tissues upon application of a new mechanical environment ostensibly provided the largest signals for the correlations and should have also minimized the limitation that changes in muscle and bone were quantified simultaneously, rather than sequentially with muscle measurements preceding bone measurements. Lastly, QTL studies have many strengths including the absence of assumptions regarding genes and molecular pathways giving rise to the trait of interest. Conversely, the identification of causative genes from the identified QTLs typically requires substantial effort[ 33 ] as QTLs can contain several hundred candidate genes[ 18 ] and we are currently pursuing a combined bioinformatic/transgenic mouse approach towards this critical goal[ 34 ]. There was a relatively small number of mice that added muscle and/or bone tissue during unloading. While we donâ€™t know the reason for this pattern, it is conceivable that specific combinations of polymorphisms caused the tissue response of these mice go into the opposite direction from what we would have expected. This is plausible because by breeding a F2 population, it is likely that some mice will have a phenotype well beyond the expected boundaries set by the two progenitor inbred strains[ 35 ]. Because of the small number of mice displaying the opposite response pattern, no underlying QTLs could be determined. Inherently, it is also possible that noise in the data measurements contributed to this phenomenon. If it was true that combinations of polymorphisms cannot only prevent the catabolic response associated with unloading but can even produce a mild anabolic response, the identification of these polymorphisms may give rise to novel countermeasures. Muscle-bone interactions have recently received considerable attention[ 6 , 19 , 36 ]. Most of the interest has focused on molecular pathways by which muscle and bone can communicate with each other, rather than on how bone perceives forces produced by muscle. For instance, novel myokines have been identified that may either promote catabolism or anabolism in bone[ 20 , 37 ]. We did not measure (changes in) biochemical factors here but the low correlations between muscle and bone at the genetic and tissue level may indicate that molecular cross-tissue communication is not necessarily driven by changes in muscle size. Excellent relations between muscle and bone quantity have been reported in a number of species including mice and humans[ 38 ]. Many of these studies were cross-sectional in nature, precluding mechanistic inferences. Some longitudinal studies in mice have proposed functional relationships between changes in bone and muscle during (un)loading[ 39 - 41 ] but they were limited to temporal relations in a single inbred strain of mice. That our longitudinal study, taking advantage of a large sample of mice with greatly different mechano-responsivities, was not able to provide evidence for a mechanism by which changes in muscle size modulate changes in bone size should not be entirely surprising. Astronauts suffer from sarcopenia and ostepenia in space but the temporal patterns of muscle and bone loss are not suggestive of a causal relation; similar to paraplegia and bedrest, bone loss continues even as loss in muscle mass plateaus[ 12 , 42 , 43 ]. Furthermore, individuals who lose the greatest amount of bone during bedrest do not coincide with those who experience the greatest amount of loss in muscle mass[ 43 ]. Also consistent with our results, there is no influence of the levels of activity (i.e., mechanical forces) on the recovery of bone mass during reambulation in mice[ 44 ]. Together, these studies suggest that the hypothesis of bone mass calibrated to altered levels of muscle cross-sectional area is not generally applicable. Our data do not disprove the general concept of a functional muscle-bone unit. They do, however, provide evidence for a lack of functional and/or genetic co-regulation of boneâ€™s and muscleâ€™s mechanosensitivity during unloading and reambulation in this genetically diverse mouse population. By extension, they also provide evidence that the relatively few, large-magnitude muscle contractions arising during daily weightbearing activities[ 45 ] are unlikely to dominate skeletal adaptation. Further, in light of the distinct genetic mechano-regulation of the two tissues, it could be speculated that the development of mechanical interventions for musculoskeletal ailments may have to be optimized independently for bone and muscle[ 46 ]. Regardless, our results emphasize that much work is required for a complete understanding of the mechanisms by which muscle and bone interact with each other while exposed to altered levels of weightbearing and that genetics is a variable that needs to be considered in these interactions.
