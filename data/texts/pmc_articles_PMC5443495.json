    "Abstract": "Abstract The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.",
    "Results": "Total body mass decreased after spaceflight but not significantly There were no significant differences in total body mass at the time of sacrifice (AEM 19.5 ± 0.5 g, Flight 18.4 ± 0.5 g). Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 7 for Flight. However, when calculated as a difference from preflight, baseline mass, we previously reported that spaceflight mice lost significantly more mass compared to AEM controls [ 35 ]. Decrease in splenocyte viability There was a significant decrease in viability of splenocytes noted in the ground control mice ( P< 0.001); 77% of splenocytes were viable in flight mice while only 68% were viable in ground controls. The difference in viability was likely due to a problem with shipping fresh tissues from the ground control mice from KSC to LLU (as described above). This difference in viability, although relatively small, must be considered in interpreting all assays involving “fresh” splenocytes presented below. Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 5 for Flight. Spaceflight decreased major splenic leukocyte subset counts There were significant flight-induced decreases in the total number of all major leukocyte populations ( P< 0.001, S2 Fig ). In terms of proportions, spaceflight caused a shift toward lymphocytes ( P< 0.001) away from granulocytes ( P< 0.001), with no significant impact on monocyte/macrophage percentages. Spaceflight decreased splenic lymphocyte subset counts Spaceflight caused decreases in the total count of all measured lymphocyte subsets ( S3 Fig ) including T ( P< 0.001), Th ( P< 0.001), Tc ( P< 0.005), B ( P< 0.001) and NK ( P< 0.05) cells. In contrast, with the exception of an increase in Tc cells percentages ( P< 0.05), there was no significant impact of spaceflight on the proportions of any lymphocytes. The proportional increase in Tc cells led to a significant, flight-induced decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio ( P< 0.01), i.e., 1.6 for flight mice versus 2.0 for AEM ground controls. Spaceflight increased splenic background ROS & oxidative burst but decreased phagocytosis As indicated in Fig 1 , we characterized the capacity of cells present in the spleen to generate an oxidative burst using both flow cytometry and a plate-based fluorescent assay. In both cases, we found significant spaceflight-induced increases ( P< 0.001). In contrast, there were decreases in phagocytic capacity in flight mice ( P< 0.001). Lastly, spaceflight increased the levels of unstimulated, background ROS ( P< 0.001). Fig 1. Effects of spaceflight on splenocyte phagocytic function.

Spaceflight increased adrenal corticosterone, decreased ACTH receptors, and did not impact catecholamine levels We observed a trend for a spaceflight-induced increase in corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands ( P = 0.066, Fig 2 ). Although there were consistent decreases noted in ACTH receptors (total or phosphorylated), these also did not reach significance. However, the corticosterone/phosphorylated ACTH receptor ratio was greater in mice who experienced spaceflight ( P< 0.05, See S1 Table ). Fig 2.

N = 11 for Ground controls, 7 for Flight. There were no significant signs of spaceflight-induced changes in the adrenal catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine ( Fig 3 ). Similarly, although there was a slight elevation in dopamine in flight mice, this was not significant. However, this elevation resulted in significant increases in the dopamine/norepinephrine ratio in spaceflight mice ( P< 0.05, See S1 Table ). Spaceflight tended to decrease the norepinephrine/corticosterone and epinephrine/corticosterone ratios ( P = 0.068 and P = 0.056, respectively, S1 Table ), but had no significant impact on the dopamine/corticosterone ratio.

Spaceflight altered liver metabolite levels We performed untargeted metabolite profiling in the liver, comparing spaceflight and AEM ground controls. The effect of spaceflight on energy and lipid metabolism in these mice has been recently described [ 35 ]. Metabolites relevant to the current discussion are included in Table 1 . We found significant increases in corticosterone as well as changes in some of the components of glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Specifically, there were decreases in GSH with corresponding increases in 2-aminobutyrate and ophthalmate, potentially indicative of increased oxidative stress. Osmolyte concentrations were altered, with increases in betaine and taurine, and decreases in alanine, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) and hypotaurine observed. Finally, we found an increase in glycerol and decreased levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate, a measure of kidney function commonly characterized in the blood. Table 1.

Similarly, although there are multiple methods for analyzing the data (e.g. basic fold changes, pathway analysis, upstream transcription regulation analysis, etc.), here we focus on genes identified though a functional analysis via IPA. This analysis allowed us to identify genes that are both functionally related (based on the current state of the literature) and statistically correlated to spaceflight. This analysis takes into consideration that, in some cases, down-regulation of a particular gene may actually lead to the activation of a particular function, or vice versa . Table 2 lists a subset of the immune and oxidative stress-related functions identified by IPA to be significantly altered in the liver by spaceflight (z-score >2.0 for activation, <-2.0 for deactivation). Generally, spaceflight appears to have up-regulated functions related to viral infections (z > 4.2) and infections of cells (z > 2.8). Likely linked to this is the activation of clathrin- and receptor-mediated endocytosis (z > 3.1 and z > 2.7, respectively), fusion of late endosomes (z > 2.1) and formation of peroxisomes (z > 2.1).

Furthermore, although z-scores did not reach the level of significance, there also are trends for the down-regulation of functions related to oxidative stress and ROS metabolism (z < -1.7). Table 3 describes the functional analyses of genes in the liver related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism. In general, functions related to the generation and sequestration of glucose are up-regulated (z > 2.0) by spaceflight, while functions related to glycolysis are down-regulated (z < -2.0). There are also strong trends for increases in functions that involve the oxidation of lipids (z > 1.8). Table 3.

PEPCK (Pck1) was unchanged. Since insulin is associated with increased glycogen storage, we also performed IPA analysis on expression of gene transcripts in the insulin signaling pathway and found that gene expression levels were decreased in the flight mice for IRS1, IRS2, PI3K and much of the MAPK pathway ( S4 Fig ).

    "Conclusion": "Spaceflight appears to have had a significant impact on both immune and metabolomic function. These differences occur in the cell count and proportion data (see S1 Discussion ), cell function, metabolites and in gene expression. As we will show, be believe these changes do not occur independently and are, in fact, linked. There were increases in background ROS levels measured in splenocytes ex vivo after flight, suggesting an increase in oxidative stress. High oxidative stress would be consistent with our results from STS-118 where we found increases in the expression of several genes in the liver involved in ROS scavenging and metabolism [ 5 ]. This would also be consistent with the increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio (due to the decrease noted in GSH levels) found in metabolomic analysis of the spaceflight livers noted here. However, although there was an increasing trend noted in another marker of oxidative stress, cysteine-glutathione disulfide, this did not reach the level of significance ( Table 1 ). Furthermore, the increase in GSSG:GSH ratio was due primarily to a decrease in GSH with no corresponding increase in GSSG. While the decrease noted in cysteinyl-glycine (cys-gly) suggests that there may be less GSH breakdown with spaceflight, there were no significant changes in any of the quantified γ-glutamyl amino acids, nor in any other metabolic components of the cycle, including 5-oxoproline, glutamate, cysteine, or glycine. This suggests a more likely explanation for the observed metabolite changes is that there was a decrease in GSH synthesis leading to a lower capacity to deal with oxidative stress. The enzymes responsible for converting glutamate, cysteine, and glycine into GSH are glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS) ( Fig 5 ). These enzymes are also part of another, separate branch of the pathway responsible for converting cystathionine (a precursor for cysteine) into ophthalmate. This is critical because although cystathionine decreased, both ophthalmate and its upstream precursor, 2-aminobutyrate, significantly increased after flight. This suggests that factors related to spaceflight are driving the kinetics of GCS towards ophthalmate production. Fig 5. Effects of spaceflight on GSH production. Open in a new tab This figure represents a combination of data generated through genomics and metabolomics. CTH = cystathionase. cys-gly = cysteinylglycine. GCS = glutamyl-cysteine synthase. GGT = gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. GS = glutathione synthase. GSH = glutathione. GSSG = glutathione (oxidized). Rectangles represent metabolomics data. Ovals represent genomics data. Grey = unchanged. Green = down-regulated. Red = up-regulated. Blue = specific transaminase unidentified. Interestingly, ophthalmate is an endogenous analog of GSH and may be a biomarker for oxidative stress and GSH depletion [ 48 , 49 ]. Consistent with these reports is the possibility that chronic exposures to the spaceflight environment could lead to a situation where GSH is depleted to such an extent that corresponding increases in downstream products such as GSSG and γ-glutamyl-AA is no longer possible. However, this would not be consistent with our transcriptomics analysis discussed above. Further study is required to clarify these findings. As indicated in Fig 5 , this switch in priorities is further suggested by our liver gene expression analysis. While there was no change in the expression of the GS gene, there was a significant decrease in GCS expression, confirming that GSH synthesis was down-regulated. Although there was a trend for a decrease in the expression of cystathionase, the enzyme for breaking cystathionine into cysteine + α-ketobutyrate, we were not able to identify the specific transaminase responsible for converting α-ketobutyrate into 2-aminobutyrate. Taken together, these results suggest that although there was an overall decrease in cystathionine, some other mechanism(s) may be driving the remaining resources toward the generation of more ophthalmate. Why this should occur is not entirely clear. However, others have reported that ophthalmate levels are increased in the liver when GSH is depleted and the supply of cysteine to the liver is depleted [ 48 ]. The end result is a reduction in the level of GSH available to scavenge ROS. Despite these changes in individual genes, functional analysis of the liver genes via IPA did not indicate any generalized, consistent increases in overall oxidative stress responses. In fact, hepatocyte-specific oxidative stress response functions all trended toward being slightly down-regulated ( Table 2 ). This suggested that something other than oxidative stress may be going on. Another possible explanation is that overall transaminase (or aminotransferase) levels increased as a consequence of muscle atrophy. Among other things, transaminases are involved in breaking proteins down into amino acids when blood sugar levels are low, usually at the expense of muscle tissue. This is interesting because spaceflight is known to induce muscle atrophy, in general, and was recently reported to do so in these mice specifically [ 50 ]. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the specific transaminase responsible for converting α-ketobutyrate into 2-aminobutyrate ( Fig 5 ) and cannot verify this hypothesis. In addition to the increases in background ROS levels in splenocytes, there were large increases in the capacity to generate an oxidative burst in the splenocytes, despite the large decreases in cell counts. Because we did not isolate phagocytic populations for these ex vivo assays, the proportion of cells in the spleen after flight is of critical importance in interpreting this result. However, increases in burst activity occurred in spite of decreases in granulocyte proportions (and no change in monocyte/macrophages) suggesting that the respiratory burst activity of the cells themselves increased. There is very little in the literature describing the impact of spaceflight on ex vivo burst activity in splenocytes after spaceflight. Kaur et al . reported decreases in burst capacity in both monocytes [ 51 ] and neutrophils [ 52 ] from the blood of astronauts collected immediately after landing. Although we did not have the opportunity to measure oxidative burst capacity in the blood of our mice, this difference in response suggests that either the response is organ-specific and/or primed populations specifically traffic to lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. An increase in induced respiratory burst activity would be consistent with our liver gene expression data which showed a functional up-regulation in the formation of peroxisomes and the fusion of late endosomes ( Table 2 ). However, as mentioned previously, there was a down-regulation in functions related to ROS metabolism. Interestingly, peroxisomes and late endosomes are also involved in lipid processing and metabolism, suggesting the increases in these cellular components may also reflect a change in gluconeogenesis [ 53 ]. Despite the increases in ROS activity, we found decreases in overall phagocytic activity in splenocytes after flight. Because this assay was performed ex vivo with a constant number of cells, and because we also saw decreases in some phagocyte proportions (e.g. granulocytes), a possible explanation for this decrease is a change in population distributions. However, the decrease in phagocytic activity (as measured by flow cytometry) was roughly 50% while the decrease in granulocyte percentage was only about 3%. We believe that it is unlikely that such a drastic decrease in phagocytic capacity would be due to such a small decrease in phagocyte proportions. Furthermore, decreases in phagocytic capacity have also been reported in both the macrophages and neutrophils in the blood of astronauts immediately after landing [ 51 , 52 ]. One possible explanation for the changes in immunocyte distribution and function is psychological/physiological stress. In support of this is the trend for a spaceflight-induced up-regulation of adrenal levels of corticosterone, an indicator of increased hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. Metabolomic analysis of both the liver (presented here) and skin [ 54 ] of these mice showed similar increases in corticosterone levels. This is also generally consistent with reports of post-flight increases in circulating corticosterone levels in rodent models [ 7 , 17 , 26 , 55 ]. A very recent study showed that cortisol levels generally increased in astronaut saliva in-flight compared to pre-flight levels, but this was only a trend [ 56 ]. Surprisingly, cortisol levels typically do not change in the blood of astronauts post-flight [ 31 , 32 , 57 , 58 ]. There are even at least two reports of decreases in plasma cortisol levels in astronauts due to flight [ 59 , 60 ]. In contrast, urinary cortisol levels typically increased after flight [ 31 , 32 , 57 – 61 ], but not always [ 51 ]. Since corticosterone is synthesized and released in the adrenal cortex and most endocrine tissues have tightly regulated homeostatic mechanisms that keep tissue levels within small discrete ranges (i.e., the amount of hormone being made is the same amount as that being released–allostasis), measuring adrenal corticosterone is not equivalent to measuring it in the blood or other organs. This suggests that the small difference in adrenal corticosterone levels between treatment groups reported here, despite fairly consistent increases found in other tissues, may actually be due to an increase in corticosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex to compensate for increased corticosterone secretion into the circulation. Decreases in spleen and thymus mass have long been associated with chronically elevated levels of corticosterone and stress [ 62 – 64 ]. We previously reported consistent decreases in spleen and thymus mass in these mice [ 1 ], as well as in rodents flown on STS-77 [ 18 ], -108 [ 2 ] and -118 [ 5 ]. While others have also reported decreases in spleen mass after flight [ 7 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 17 ], there is at least one report of an increase [ 55 ]. Similarly, thymus mass has generally been shown to decrease after flight [ 9 , 12 , 17 ], but there are some reports of increases [ 17 , 55 ]. If spaceflight-subjected mice were indeed stressed as other findings here and in the literature suggest, particularly during the landing, then this should be reflected in ACTH activity. Adrenal corticosterone secretion is known to be up-regulated by ACTH receptor ligation on adrenocortical cells (predominantly in the zona fasciculata ). An increase in corticosterone should be coincident with an increase in ACTH levels. Indeed, while plasma ACTH levels did not change in the blood of astronauts after flight [ 32 , 58 , 60 ], urinary ACTH levels increased [ 32 ]. Although we did not characterize adrenal ACTH levels directly, we did measure ACTH receptors. Because ACTH receptors are unique G protein-coupled receptors in that ligand activation up-regulates their expression [ 65 – 68 ], this should provide an indirect measure of ACTH activity and HPA activation. However, we did not find significant effects of spaceflight on ACTH receptor expression. Similarly, the percentage of phosphorylated ACTH receptors in the adrenals did not differ between treatment groups after flight. This would seem to suggest that the chronic exposure to the conditions of spaceflight promotes receptor desensitization and suggests that spaceflight may actually reduce the sensitivity to stress. Adrenal catecholamines are mediators of stress-induced activation of the sympathoadrenomedullary (SAM) axis, and like corticosterone, their production and secretion into the circulation typically increases in response to stress. However, despite the noted increases in corticosterone, we found no changes in adrenal norepinephrine and epinephrine levels. There is very little published in the literature involving activation of the SAM axis after spaceflight in rodent models. However, norepinephrine levels in the kidney of rats either do not change [ 69 ] or actually decreased [ 70 ] after spaceflight. Interestingly, urinary epinephrine levels did not change [ 31 , 51 , 52 ] or increased [ 32 , 57 , 60 , 61 ] in astronauts after flight. Similarly, urinary norepinephrine levels either did not change [ 51 , 52 ] or increased [ 31 , 32 , 57 , 60 ]. Because urinary catecholamine levels are usually assessed using pooled samples collected over a 24-hour period post-landing, we believe that the reported increases are reflective of a response to the landing and not the actual spaceflight environment. These data suggest that while there may have been an activation of stress pathways after spaceflight, the response was relatively mild and likely did not involve both HPA and SNS activation. Although speculative, given the lack of a significant catecholamine response, it is possible that this elevation in corticosterone is not directly related to psychological stress at all. But rather, the change is related to energy balance and lipid metabolism. As previously stated, spaceflight has long been suspected to alter energy metabolism [ 71 ] and stress hormones like glucocorticoids (i.e. corticosterone) are known to play a significant role in metabolism [ 72 , 73 ]. Indeed, corticosterone promotes fat breakdown in adipose and muscle tissue to provide glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis. Consistent with this idea is the fact that the metabolite, glycerol, was also more abundant in flight liver relative to ground controls. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) regulated activity increased significantly in the liver after flight. This is important because although the primary function of PPARs is to regulate lipid metabolism, PPARs can also negatively interfere with immune regulators including NF-κB, STAT, and AP-1 signaling pathways [ 74 – 79 ]. PPARs also mediate macrophage responses in the arterial cell wall [ 76 , 77 , 80 , 81 ], both by interfering with chemoattraction and adhesion of immunocytes, including T cells and monocytes, and by down-regulating MCP-1 [ 82 ], RANTES [ 83 ], and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) [ 75 , 84 ]. We have demonstrated that lipid metabolism and PPAR activity are altered in spaceflight [ 35 ]. Given that many of the functional changes we see in immune response overlap considerably with energy/lipid metabolism, we believe that the two phenomena may actually be related. We observed a profound loss of glycogen stores in the livers of Flight mice. Paradoxically, most regulators of glycogen synthesis were increased, concomitant with a decrease in glycogen phosphorylase mRNA expression, pointing to upregulation of glycogenic rather than glycogenolytic pathways. This may be due, in part, to activation of compensatory mechanisms for restoring normal levels of glycogen stores. PEPCK (Pck1) mRNA expression was unchanged; therefore gluconeogenesis as a mechanism for restoring glycogen was likely not activated. We did not observe changes in hepatic glucose or glucose-6-phosphate concentrations and unfortunately did not have access to blood to measure serum glucose or insulin levels. However, the intracellular downregulation of IRS, PI3K and MAPK pathway genes are classical post-receptor manifestations of insulin resistance that may be induced by lipotoxicity, as we have previously shown [ 35 ]. Taken together, our data support the concept of spaceflight-induced alterations in the response to insulin that may correlate with insulin resistance. It will be important to obtain serum in future studies to measure insulin levels in mice and further pursue this link. In conclusion, spaceflight clearly causes transient changes in immune function. However, the cause may not be exclusively due to psychological or oxidative stress. But rather, the shifts in immune function may be at least partially due to shifts in energy needs in space. Onset of leukocyte regeneration after landing could, of course, also have a significant impact on functional status. As a full description of the impact of spaceflight on lipid metabolism is beyond the scope of this paper, the details of this have been covered elsewhere [ 35 ]. However, gene expression functional analysis indicated increases in functions related to glucose synthesis and sequestration, with corresponding decreases in glycolysis functions. Furthermore, the ex vivo increases in ROS activity, combined with corresponding increases in peroxisome and endosome-related gene expression, are likely related to spaceflight-induced shifts in lipid metabolism. This further suggests that spaceflight causes a shift in priorities in phagocytic populations away from antigen processing toward lipid processing, potentially increasing risk for infection.",
