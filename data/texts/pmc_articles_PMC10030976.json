    "Conclusion": "With this work, we aimed to advocate the urgency of sustainable approaches for human space exploration, and the essential role microbial biotechnologies could play in this. It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. In parallel, several of these microbially-supported processes may also help close the loop on LSS and other systems, which can preserve resources and extra-terrestrial environments. These two aspects, independently and together, enable space exploration in a sustainable fashion. To provide appropriate conditions for the maturation of named biotechnologies and to open the field to a wider community, research and innovation are needed. Preliminary studies should be supported in laboratories on Earth, simulation platforms, and in LEO, and full investigations in cis -Lunar space and on the Lunar surface. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Funding should take into account the high cost (and time) of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, on which these technologies will likely heavily rely. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically. The debate about the public benefits of space travel and exploration is healthy and necessary, but in the field of sustainability, space advocates may now have an opportunity to win this debate for a generation.",
