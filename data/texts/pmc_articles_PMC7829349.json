    "Abstract": "Abstract Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.

    "Results": "Isolates Recovered From the ISS The E. faecalis isolates recovered from air samples (ISS_1 and ISS_4) were both collected mid-module. ISS_1 was isolated from air samples collected in the United States Lab in 2009, and ISS_4 was recovered from the air in Node 3 in 2013 ( Figure 1 ). ISS_2 and ISS_3, were two isolates recovered in 2011 from the same location, United States Lab handrail surfaces, approximately 14 feet apart. One was collected from the aft end of the module (at the interface with Node 1), and the other was recovered mid-module. The United States Lab was launched in 2001, and houses the various science payloads conducting research onboard the ISS ( Singh et al., 2018b ). Node 3, launched in 2010, and houses the air revitalization and water recovery systems, as well as amenities for crew hygiene, the restrooms, and exercise devices ( Singh et al., 2018b ). With preliminary identification based solely on the VITEK identification system, the first task for the isolate characterization was to create a fully sequenced genome for each isolate ( Table 1 ). Pangenome Analysis With the complete genomes for each isolate assembled, several web-based tools were utilized for genomic characterization. First, seven gene loci were evaluated for their respective MLST using the web-based MLST server ( Table 1 ; Larsen et al., 2012 ). ISS_1 was determined to be a single locus variant of sequence type (ST) 875, with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 583 bases of pstS . Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 were identified as ST30. ISS_4 was classified as ST40, a commonly recovered ST and a member of one of the largest clonal clusters, CC40 ( McBride et al., 2007 ). A clonal cluster is defined as a ST consisting of three or more isolates ( McBride et al., 2007 ). CC40 is comprised of ST40 and ST114, many of which were isolated from clinical sources ( McBride et al., 2007 ). Based on the ST data described above, representative type strains were chosen for each as a comparator for each ISS ST ( McBride et al., 2007 ), and a core genome of 1,844 genes shared by all 51 strains was defined ( Page et al., 2015 ). An alignment of the core genome was then used to construct the phylogenetic tree ( Figure 2A ). Phylogenetic proximity of the selected type strains to the ISS isolates validated the selection based on ST. Genome size and gene count ( Figure 2B ) show patterns of genomic expansion and loss within clades; for example, within the clade containing V583 a general pattern of larger genome size and higher gene count is evident, yet nearby ISS_1 has a more streamlined genome in comparison to its neighbors. Genes are classified into core, soft core, shell, and cloud on the basis of the number of isolates sharing each gene ( Figure 2C ; Supplementary Figure S1 ) and the Roary-estimated patterns of gene presence and absence highlight potential patterns of gene loss or gain ( Supplementary Data File S1 ). Unique chromosomal genes, defined as those genes that were present in a single isolate, were non-uniformly distributed across each isolate genome ( Supplementary Data File S1 ). ISS_1 (Accession no.: CP046113 ) contained the fewest number of unique genes (11 genes), 9 of which were designated hypothetical by Prokka ( Seemann, 2014 ) yet had homology with other E. faecalis genomes on the basis of BLASTn searches. Seven of the 11 unique genes formed a contiguous region suggestive of an operon, which contained two genes with known annotations, mazG , which encodes a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase involved in survival under nutrient stress, and another that encodes an LPxTG-motif protein cell wall anchor domain protein. Neither ISS_2 (Accession no.: CP046112 ) nor ISS_3 (Accession no.: CP046111 ) contained individually unique genes. Consistent with this finding, analysis of the core alignment revealed that isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 differed by only 14 bases. However, these two isolates shared 39 genes that were not present in any of the other strains analyzed, of which 30 were classified as hypothetical. ISS_4 (Accession no.: CP046108-110 ) had 25 unique genes, 16 of which were located on a plasmid (pTEF2); no unique genes were found on the second (pAD1) plasmid. Based on BLASTn analysis ( Supplementary Figure S2 ), the majority of genes unique to the ISS strains are closely related to genes present in Enterococcus species, with all non- Enterococcus genera restricted to Lactococcus , Lactobacillus , and, with lower identity and query coverage, Listeria ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Following the designations of McBride et al. (2007) , the capsule type for each ISS strain was determined. All three known capsule type polymorphisms were detected from the ISS strains. ISS_1 contained the full cps locus (EF2485 to EF2495) and hcp1 (EF2484), and similar to MMH594 and V583, was designated CPS type 2. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained the cps locus and hcp1 , but lacked cpsF (EF0090). In agreement with previous analysis of two additional ST30 isolates ( McBride et al., 2007 ), these strains were classified as CPS type 5. The strain ISS_4 contained only cpsA (EF0095), cpsB (EF0094), and hcp1 , and like the other isolates of CC40 and OG1RF, was classified as CPS type 1 ( McBride et al., 2007 ). Assessment of Mobile Elements and Defense Systems The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) database identified the tetracycline resistance gene, tetW/N/W , in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, which was not present in OG1RF ( Jia et al., 2016 ). The ISS tetW/N/W shared 69.3 (ISS_2 and ISS_3) and 69.1% (ISS_4) sequence homology with the reference sequence (Accession no.: ARO:3004442 ). The reference gene has been detected in 2.70% of the available E. faecalis isolates surveyed ( Jia et al., 2016 ). A standard nucleotide BLAST search confirmed the tetW/N/W genes present in ISS_2 and ISS_3 shared 100% sequence identity to each other, and differed by three SNPs to the tetW/N/W gene present in ISS_4 ( Altschul et al., 1990 ). PHASTER identified the presence of intact phage in isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 ( Supplementary Table S3 ; Arndt et al., 2016 ). ISS_2 and ISS_3 each contained three intact phage nucleotide sequences. The CC40 member ISS_4 contained a single intact phage region. No intact phage were detected in either ISS_1 or OG1RF. Thirty two (82%) of the 39 genes shared only by ISS_2 and ISS_3 were associated with intact or incomplete phage ( Supplementary Data File S1 ). Plasmid-born genomic elements were only detected in ISS_4 using the tool PlasmidFinder ( Table 1 ; Carattoli et al., 2014 ). Two plasmids were determined to share 96.7% sequence identity, and 99% coverage, to the V583 plasmid pTEF2 (accession number: AE016831 ; Paulsen et al., 2003 ), and 96.0% identity, with 100% coverage, to the pheromone responsive plasmid pAD1 (accession number: L01794 ; Ehrenfeld and Clewell, 1987 ). Notably, evidence for Lactobacillus prophage Lj928 was identified for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and V583 ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Similarly, evidence for Enterococcus phage phiFL4A was identified for ISS_2, ISS_3, ISS_4, and MMH594 ( Supplementary Table S3 ). Overall, mobile elements explained a majority (65%) of the unique genes identified in the ISS isolates. High confidence CRISPR-Cas systems were detected in isolates ISS_1, ISS_4, and OG1RF ( Supplementary Table S4 ). CRISPR loci without the Cas genes were detected in the genomes of each of the ISS isolates and OG1RF ( Supplementary Table S4 ). Genome-Based Assessment of the Potential for Pathogenicity The PathogenFinder server scored each of the ISS isolates and the reference strains as potential human pathogens ( Table 1 ; Cosentino et al., 2013 ). The commensal strain OG1RF had the lowest pathogen score of 81.6%. With pathogen scores > 84%, all of the ISS strains had a higher assigned probability to be pathogenic than the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583 (each at 82.9%). By comparing the genomic content of the isolates to known E. faecalis genes associated with disease, a second predictor of pathogenicity could be compiled ( Table 3 ; Joensen et al., 2014 ). The genomes of the clinical isolates contained the highest proportion of predicted virulence factors (18/20), while ISS_2 and ISS_3 contained the least (13/20). ISS_1 and OG1RF both contained 15/20 virulence factors, and the genome ISS_4 was positive for 16/20. The clinical isolates and ISS_4 were the only strains to contain agg , encoding for the E. faecalis aggregation substance involved in biofilm formation, plasmid transfer, and increased virulence in endocarditis models ( Bhatty et al., 2015 ).

MMH594 was the only isolate with cylA , one of the genes responsible for the production of cytolysin. Neither OG1RF nor the ISS isolates carried any of the genes in the cytolysin pathway reviewed by Coburn and Gilmore (2003) . Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of Antibiotics Dilution concentration broth assays were used to determine the MIC for various antibiotics. Optical density measurements revealed there were no significant differences in the growth kinetics between the ISS isolates and the reference strains. Strains were first evaluated in Mueller-Hinton broth for comparison to clinical laboratory standards for antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis ATCC ® 29212 ( CLSI, 2017 ), and in the commonly used growth media BHI to determine MICs relative to the commensal isolate OG1RF. In MH broth, all strains tested exceeded the resistance levels set forth by ≥ 2-fold for amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamycin, and kanamycin ( CLSI, 2017 ). ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 were also categorized as resistant to tetracycline. When evaluated in BHI, all ISS strains exhibited MICs equivalent to OG1RF with the exceptions of oxacillin and tetracycline ( Table 4 ). All ISS strains showed ≥ 4-fold more resistance to oxacillin. Isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, each carrying a tetW/N/W gene, displayed an MIC of 64 μg mL –1 . These isolates were 4-fold more resistant to tetracycline than OG1RF (MIC of 16 μg mL –1 ), and displayed resistance levels equivalent to the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583. Unlike the clinical isolates, the ISS strains did not exhibit HLGR. TABLE 4. Minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics evaluated in BHI.

For the remainder of the experiment, the RH was maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite ® . The concentration of cells surviving the drying process ( N 0 ) ranged from 1.2 (± 0.044) x 10 10 to 5.5 (± 0.091) x 10 7 CFU for ISS-1 and OG1RF, respectively. The average number of survivors ( N ) after three weeks of desiccation ranged from 0.11 (± 0.024) to 8.5 (± 0.79) x 10 8 CFU for OG1RF and MMH594, respectively. OG1RF demonstrated the greatest loss in viability during dry down with a 2.1-log reduction, and ISS-2 was the only isolate that did not experience a significant loss in viability between t = 0 and t = 3 d ( p = 0.11). There was no significant difference in N/N 0 at any of the timepoints evaluated ( p = 0.98; Figure 3 ). When the variances of N/N 0 at t = 21 d for each isolate were determined to be significantly different from each other ( F = 58, p < 0.001), a non-parametric comparison was performed with OG1RF chosen as the control using the Steel method. There was no significant difference in N/N 0 at t = 21 d among the isolates tested when compared to OG1RF ( Figure 3 ). FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Desiccation survival of Enterococcus faecalis strains from the ISS and the control strains, OG1RF and MMH594. The data are presented as the average (± SD) of triplicate measurements. Some error bars have been obscured by the data points. Pathogenicity of Isolates in a C. elegans Model The survival data ( Figure 4 ) were determined to follow the normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test ( Han et al., 2016 ). With the exception of ISS_1, all data are reported as the mean (± SE) of three replicates. For ISS_1, one sample became contaminated with fungus on day 9, and all subsequent data are reported as N = 2. C. elegans was least susceptible to strains ISS_2, ISS_3, and V583 with mean survival times of 13 (± 0.53), 13 (± 0.59), and 11 (± 0.91) days, respectively ( Table 2 ). While the time for 50% of the worm population to die (LT 50 ; Garsin et al., 2001 ) for these isolates ranged from 9 days (V583) to 14 (ISS_3), the total lifespan of worms challenged with these isolates were not significantly different from each other. For isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, all worms were deceased by day 18 and 17, respectively. While 90% of worms fed V583 were dead by day 18, some survivors persisted until day 24. Additionally, the lifespan of worms infected with ISS_3 was also statistically similar to those challenged with ISS_4. With a 31% decrease in the mean lifespan, worms infected with ISS_1 were significantly more susceptible than isolates fed ISS_2 or ISS_3 ( p < 0.001). Based on the survival curves of worms fed ISS_1, ISS_4, OG1RF, MMH594, and V583 there were no significant differences in the pathogenicity profiles for these isolates ( p > 0.05). FIGURE 4.

    "Conclusion": "While multiple studies have detected the presence of a wide range of opportunistic human pathogens onboard the ISS, the consensus was that additional data was needed to determine if these microorganisms posed an actual threat to crew health ( Schiwon et al., 2013 ; Be et al., 2017 ; Lang et al., 2017 ; Singh et al., 2018a , b ; Mora et al., 2019 ; Sielaff et al., 2019 , Sobisch et al., 2019 ; Urbaniak et al., 2019 ). Here, we expanded upon previous genomic analyses in an effort to provide a framework for the determination of the pathogenic potential of E. faecalis isolates. For the comparative analyses, the commensal type strain OG1RF and the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583, were chosen because of their extensive genotypic ( Shankar et al., 2002 ; Paulsen et al., 2003 ; McBride et al., 2007 ; Bourgogne et al., 2008 ) and phenotypic characterization, specifically in regards to C. elegans pathogenesis ( Garsin et al., 2001 ; Yuen and Ausubel, 2018 ). In addition, the E. faecalis genomes of strains 5952 and JH-1 were chosen as representative ST strains of the ISS isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, and ISS_4, respectively. While the amount of information that can be gleaned from a complete genome is large, the current methodologies ( Singh et al., 2018a ) are insufficient for the accurate assessment of pathogenicity for E. faecalis strains. The scores from the tool, PathogenFinder ( Cosentino et al., 2013 ), predicted each of the ISS isolates as possessing > 84% probability of being pathogenic to humans, placing them above known clinical isolates MMH594 and V583 ( Table 1 ). Another tool related to scoring pathogenicity, VirFinder, identified twenty virulence factors among the ISS strains, but fifteen were present in the commensal isolate OG1RF as well ( Table 3 ). We cautiously interpret this to mean that ISS isolates do share some of the potentially virulence-related properties found in clinical isolates, but many of these are also shared by prototype commensal strains of E. faecalis . Further validation for these predictive algorithms applied to enterococci is needed in order to make more accurate predictions of which strains could impact human health. Predictions from PathogenFinder or its equivalent can be expected to improve if additional training data at the genus or species level is incorporated. Because of the difficulty in interpreting potential pathogenicity of the ISS strains based on genome content alone, we tested them directly in the C. elegans infection model ( Figure 4 ). Previous studies identified parallels in the pathogenicity profiles of various enterococcal lineages when tested in C. elegans ( Garsin et al., 2001 ) and in mice ( Bourgogne et al., 2008 ). In contrast to that report ( Garsin et al., 2001 ), we did not detect significant difference in C. elegans survival when exposed to commensal OG1RF, or pathogenic V583 and the cytolytic strain MMH594. E. faecalis proliferate in the intestine of C. elegans ( Garsin et al., 2001 ) ultimately occluding it ( Yuen and Ausubel, 2018 ). As a result, C. elegans infected with E. faecalis reach the LT 50 33% faster than worms fed a normal diet of E. coli OP50 ( Garsin et al., 2001 ). None of the E. faecalis strains tested here, including ISS strains, exhibited enhanced C. elegans killing ( Figure 4 ). Closely related strains ISS_2 and 3, despite possessing a high computed pathogenicity score, were found to be least able to kill C. elegans ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, there are currently no validated methods to predict phenotypic responses of enterococci to environmental stressors ( e.g ., desiccation, starvation, increased cosmic radiation) based on their genomic content alone. Because each of the ISS isolates were recovered from air and surface samples, we examined them specifically for the ability to survive desiccation at RH relevant to the clinical environment ( ASHRAE, 2013 ). In general, members of the genus Enterococcus are more desiccation tolerant than closely related microorganisms ( Lebreton et al., 2017 ). Blaustein et al. (2019) demonstrated that the spaceflight environment onboard the ISS did not select for “extremo-tolerant” strains of B. cereus and S. aureus . Likewise, we found no significant differences in desiccation tolerance between the ISS E. faecalis isolates and their representative type strains ( Figure 3 ). This indicates that their environmental survival in the ISS was attributable to the previously described intrinsically rugged nature of E. faecalis ( Lebreton et al., 2017 ). Tirumalai et al. (2018) compared the genomes of the highly resistant B. safensis FO-36b and B. pumilus SAFR-032 to over 60 reference strains, and also failed to find genomic signatures for their increased environmental resistances ( e.g. , desiccation, starvation, increased ultraviolet radiation). Rather, it is more likely the regulation of a suite of genes that confers increased resistance as a generalized stress response. In agreement with Blaustein et al. (2019) we conclude that the interior space environment ( e.g. , microgravity, increased cosmic radiation) selects for intrinsically rugged species of bacteria, such as E. faecalis , but as of yet, there is no evidence suggesting selection for enhanced environmental persistence. In agreement with previous observations ( Schiwon et al., 2013 ; Sobisch et al., 2019 ), the E. faecalis isolates examined here were resistant to multiple antibiotics. While the detection of multidrug resistant bacteria may sound alarming, much of that resistance is intrinsic to all enterococci, and other genetic signatures indicate that these are largely commensal strains ( Table 3 ). However, resistance to tetracycline displayed by ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 was found to be mediated by an acquired tetW/N/W gene, which confers an MIC equivalent to that of clinical isolates ( Table 4 ). In addition to harboring genes that make combating infections difficult, E. faecalis strains possess the ability to spread antibiotic resistance to genes to other bacterial species, including the commonly isolated ISS inhabitant S. aureus ( Sobisch et al., 2019 ). Although there have been no reports of VRE isolated from onboard the ISS at the time of this publication, it is important to note that both vancomycin resistance genes and E. faecalis genomic signatures were detected concurrently from the surface of the dining table during expedition 43 ( Singh et al., 2018b ). During the same mission, E. faecalis was also ranked the second most abundant BSL-2 microorganism in the metagenomic analysis of the entire campaign ( Singh et al., 2018b ). In fact, Mora et al. (2019) determined Enterococcus to be one of the ten indicator genera that distinguished the ISS microbiome from the human and indoor samples of the Home Microbiome Project ( Mora et al., 2019 ). There were several limitations to the data presented above. The desiccation survival experiments were terminated before any significant decrease in viability was observed. Extending the experiment until no surviving cells remained may have revealed a difference in the survival curves among the strains and provide insight to the length of time E. faecalis can remain viable. The lack of experimentally validated computational tools for E. faecalis led to conflicting results when comparing the genomes known clinical isolates to commensal strains. In addition, C. elegans serves as a rudimentary model system for human infection. However, the challenges presented here provide the foundation for future investigations of E. faecalis , on Earth or in space. As members of the core gut microbiome, E. faecalis will continue to be transported to the ISS and the ability to detect pathogenic strains will be beneficial for crew health. Unlike most environmental bacteria ( Staley and Konopka, 1985 ), E. faecalis strains are routinely recovered on culture media. Based on the antibiotic resistance profiles presented here, incorporating the above high-level aminoglycosides to the routine onboard culturing activities could serve as the first step toward distinguishing pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis . Because of their commonness as survivors on abiotic surfaces, their potential ability to infect, as well as the ability of E. faecalis to readily acquire and spread mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance, continued microbial monitoring and pathogen identification will be important. Current microbial monitoring of ISS air and surface sampling occurs once a month for the first 90 days of a mission, and decreases to one sample event for every 90 days thereafter ( ISS-MORD, 2013 ). Because these microbial monitoring procedures are culture based, there is an inherent bias toward the small fraction of bacterial species that will form a colony on a plate ( Staley and Konopka, 1985 ). Assessing the total microbial burden, and viable fraction, by combining genomic and culture-based analyses provides a more accurate representation of the ISS microbiome ( Be et al., 2017 ; Mora et al., 2019 ; Sielaff et al., 2019 ). However, it is still unclear which, if any, of these microorganisms are relevant to crew health ( Schiwon et al., 2013 ; Be et al., 2017 ; Lang et al., 2017 ; Singh et al., 2018a , b ; Mora et al., 2019 ; Sielaff et al., 2019 ; Sobisch et al., 2019 ; Urbaniak et al., 2019 ). The need for expedient identification of pathogenic microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles is not a challenge unique to the spaceflight environment. Recent advances in rapid diagnostics have helped alleviate the clinical reliance on culture based techniques to identify infectious agents, yet these resources are not always widely available ( Maurer et al., 2017 ). Fortunately, this is not the case for the ISS where the crew have access to Wetlab-2 Cepheid© SmartCycyler that can be used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of air, surface, water, and clinical samples 3 . Although it is currently configured to detect only a limited number of microbial pathogens, the RAZOR TM EX BioDetection System (Idaho Technology Inc.) is currently being developed for in-flight microbial monitoring and could be modified for a wider range of microbial targets. Another promising technology for pathogen detection is the ONT MinION sequencing device employed above. Castro-Wallace et al. (2017) have previously validated its efficacy in the spacecraft environment. The MinION is currently capable of identifying bacterial species in near real time from metagenomic data ( Sanderson et al., 2018 ) or isolated samples ( Gargis et al., 2019 ) and has been used for the first ever off-Earth identification of bacteria cultured and sequenced in flight ( Burton et al., 2020 ). Due to the inability for the existing tools to distinguish pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis , we make the following recommendations: Rather than continuing to wait for sample return and analysis using the current unvalidated databases, we suggest performing an initial screen for HLGR. Then, any isolates exhibiting HLGR should be sequenced using the MinION and evaluated for the presence of the type 2 capsule ( McBride et al., 2007 ), the vancomycin resistance operon observed in V583 ( Paulsen et al., 2003 ), components of the pathogenicity island ( e.g ., cytolysin production loci and the enterococcal surface protein, Esp), and the absence of functional CRISPR-Cas arrays ( Van Tyne et al., 2019 ). This information would then provide near real-time information for the crew regarding the need for additional decontamination procedures. These advancements would not be limited to E. faecalis isolates, however more accurate genomic targets for additional pathogen detection will need to be experimentally validated ( Chiu and Miller, 2019 ). With the development of such targets, multiple pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) can quickly be identified within a single sample ( Miller et al., 2019 ).",
