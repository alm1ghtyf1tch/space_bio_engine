    "Abstract": "Abstract Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO 2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens . The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1 T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.

    "Results": "Several yeast strains belonging to the Naganishia ( Cryptococcus ) diffluens clade of Filobasidiales were isolated from two different flight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS [ 5 ]. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1 T , IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identified to be novel species belonging to the genus Naganishia, based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations #1, #2, and #3), Node 1 (Locations #4 and #5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location #6), U.S. Laboratory (Location #7), and Node 2 (Locations #8 and control). A detailed description of the various locations sampled was published elsewhere [ 59 ]. Strains IF6SW-B1, IF7SW-B1, and IF1SW-F1, were isolated during first sampling from Locations 6, 7, and 1, respectively. Strain IIF5SW-F1 was isolated from second sampling at Location 5. 3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Naganishia . The MycoBank database documented 19 Naganishia species, and the CBS database showed only 11 Naganishia species. The gene sequences available on NCBI for Naganishia species ( n = 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees with C. neoformans CBS 132 strain as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II ( RPB1 and RPB2 ), translation elongation factor 1-α ( TEF1 ), and cytochrome b ( CYTB ), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species [ 2 ]. The respective gene sequences that were available on NCBI for different Naganishia species were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members from Tremellomycetes ( Goffeauzyma gastricus CBS 2288 ( AF145323.1 ), Heterocephalacria arrabidensis CBS 8678 ( AF444362.2 ), Piskurozyma cylindrica CBS 8680 ( AF444360.1 ), Solicoccozyma aerius CBS155 ( AF145324.1 ), and Tremella mesenterica CBS 6973 ( AF444433.1 )) were included with Cryptococcus neoformans CBS 132 ( AF444326.1 ) as the outgroup. Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB , RPB1 , RPB2 , and TEF1 genes were generated and are presented in Supplemental Figures S1–S7 . When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no significant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences ( Figure S3 ), whereas the other four genes ( CYTB , RPB1 , RPB2 , and TEF1 ) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all the Naganishia species. The ITS tree ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species, N. diffluens, N. liquefaciens and N. albidosimilis . ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100% similarity to the sequence of N. albidosimilis CBS 7711 T ( AF145325 ), N. liquefaciens CBS 968 T ( AF444345 ), and N. diffluens CBS 160 T ( AF145330 ). However, ITS sequences of N. vishniacii CBS 7110 T shared 97.84% similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145320 .), N. uzbekistanensis CBS 8683 T had 97.55% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF444339 ), and N. adeliensis CBS 8351 T exhibited 97.34% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145328 ) with ISS isolates ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). In the LSU tree ( Supplemental Figure S2 ), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished from N. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii , and N. albidosimilis with low bootstrap support. Comparing the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71% similarity to N. albida (type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075474 ), 96.41% similarity to N. albidosimilis (type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF137601 ), 96.25% similarly to N. liquefaciens (type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF181515 ), and 95.92% similarity to N. diffluens (type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075502 ) ( Supplemental Figure S2 ). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51% in the LSU region and 99.21% in the ITS region [ 1 ]. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates confirm they belong to a new species in the genus Naganishia (order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species. The other phylogenetic trees based on CYTB , RPB1 , RPB2 , and TEF1 grouped the ISS strains together, and the closest neighbor was identified as N. diffluens . Subsequently, MLST was carried out by manually concatenating the seven genes ( Figure 1 ). The MLST phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the same clade with N. diffluens CBS 160 T ( Figure 1 ). The individual gene-based and MLST tree-based analyses both further supported the finding that the four ISS strains belong to the same species which is closely related to, but separate from, N. diffluens . This suggested that the four ISS strains were novel species of the genus Naganishia . All four strains were isolated during different flights and sampling sessions at various locations, suggesting that these isolates are not clonal but persisting in the ISS environment. The ecological significance of this finding, in the closed system aboard the ISS warrants, further study. The genomes of four ISS strains were sequenced, draft genome was assembled, annotated, and the results were published elsewhere [ 6 ]. The genome size was ~19.4 Mbp with GC content between 53–56%, similar to other members of the genus Naganishia . Figure 1.

Titan-like Cell Characterization of Novel ISS Strains IF6SW-B1 T strain was grown under culture conditions similar to those used for titanization of C. neoformans , and analyzed using a variety of microscopy techniques. Cell size and cell wall thickness were determined using Calcofluor White stain ( Figure 2 ), Titan-like cell morphology using SEM ( Figure 3 ), and cell wall structure using TEM ( Figure 4 ). The Calcofluor White Stain ( Figure 2 A) binds with chitin contained within cell walls, and once triggered by its excitation wavelength (380 nm), the stain fluoresces and emits blue light at 475 nm. Bright-field images were captured alongside Calcofluor White images to show cell distribution and confirm successful Calcofluor White staining, while Calcofluor White micrographs were used to measure the size of the cells and their thickness ( Figure 2 A). Figure 2 B shows the cell size in diameter (µm) under various growth conditions, whereas Figure 2 C depicts the cell wall thickness. The size of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity conditions and in the presence of 5% CO 2 with standard Earth gravity ranged from 2.5 µm to 6 µm; however, the cells grown under 5% CO 2 were statistically significantly larger ( p ≤ 0.05). When the strain was grown under 5% CO 2 and simulated microgravity (µG) conditions, the cell size increased at least two to three times in size (4 µm to 13 µm; mean increased size of ~10 µm) and was statistically significantly larger than both the standard gravity control ( p ≤ 0.0001) and the 5% CO 2 treatment ( p ≤ 0.0001) ( Figure 2 B). There was no statistical difference for cell wall thickness between the standard gravity control and the 5% CO 2 grow cells (ns). However, the cell wall thickness was two to three-times larger when cells were grown under simulated microgravity conditions compared with the other two culture conditions (0.55 µm and 0.40–0.39 µm, respectively), these findings were statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.0001) ( Figure 2 C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Confocal microscope-based analyses of N. tulchinskyi cells when grown under standard Earth gravity (SD), normal gravity with 5% CO 2 (CO), and simulated microgravity with 5% CO 2 (µG). Representative images of Calcofluor White cell wall-stained cells adjacent to bright field images are shown in ( A ). The µG cells appear to be larger and misshapen when compared to the typical yeast morphology demonstrated by SD and CO. Measurements for cell diameter were taken using the of Calcofluor White confocal images ( B ). Though smaller than µG cells, SD cells were statically smaller in cell size than CO cells ( p value = 0.0440), while µG cells were statistically significantly larger than both SD and CO cells ( p value ≤ 0.0001). Cell wall thickness was also measured using confocal microscopy ( C ). Cell wall thickness of SD and CO were not statistically different in size ( p value ≥ 0.9999); however, µG cells had statistically significantly larger cell walls than both SD and CO cells ( p value ≤ 0.0001). The scale bars for both confocal and bright field microscopic images is 40 µm. Statistical significance is reported as p value > 0.05 (ns), ≤0.05 (*), ≤0.01 (**), ≤0.001 (***), ≤0.0001 (****). p values of ≤0.01 (**) and ≤0.001 (***) were not noticed. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of SD, CO, and µG grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in conidia size, morphology, and daughter cell budding. SD ( A ) and CO ( B ) grown cells demonstrated similar standard yeast morphotypes, while µG ( C , D ) grown cells are larger, nonuniform in appearance, and exhibit random budding scars. In some instances, the µG budding scars have raised centers, while others appear to be concave. Additionally, some budding scars appear to be shedding or peeling from the surface of the cells. This phenomenon is highlighted with the white arrow ( D ). Representative SEM micrographs are given, and scale bar for all micrographs is 10 µm. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Analyses of transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs of SD ( A , B ), CO ( C , D ), and µG ( E , F ) grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in cell size, cell wall thickness, and internal organelle structures. SD and CO demonstrate similar size cells and similar intracellular morphology, while µG grown cells appear to have a different internal organizational structure of organelles. At higher magnifications (lower panels), the cell wall thickness can be seen to be thicker for µG grown cells than for SD or CO grown cells. The cells also appear to be having lower abundance of fine scale fimbriae on the surface of µG cells, as compared to SD and CO grown cells. Along with their large size, the µG grown cells are distinguished by the shedding and peeling bud scars from their surfaces, denoted by white arrows ( C ). Additionally, µG grown cells have the presence of large unknown organelles/structures, as denoted by the black arrow. Representative TEM micrographs are given. The scale bar for ( A , C , E ) is 1 µm, and the scale bare for ( B , D , F ) is 0.2 µm. The budding scars in IF6SW-B1 T strain seemed to exhibit normal bipolar budding pattern when grown under standard gravity ( Figure 3 A) and when grown and exposed to 5% CO 2 with standard Earth gravity ( Figure 3 B). However, when the strain is grown under simulated microgravity and 5% CO 2 conditions, multilateral budding is seen ( Figure 3 C,D). In addition, the budding cells were not as predominant under microgravity as those grown under normal gravity conditions ( Figure 3 A). Finally, when the IF6SW-B1 T strain was grown under 5% CO 2 , as well as simulated microgravity ( Figure 3 C,D) conditions, observations of budding cells were much less commonly observed, whereas the budding scars were evident and appeared to take up a larger proportional area on the yeast cell surface. The budding scars under simulated microgravity conditions range in morphology and size from 2–3 µm raised prominences extending 1–2 µm from the cell surface to large flat raised rings up to 5 µm in diameter ( Figure 3 C,D). Despite these morphological differences, microgravity grown yeast cells were viable when re-streaked onto a PDA plate. Comparatively, the number of viable cells was less when grown under 5% CO 2 and simulated microgravity compared to the other standard atmosphere and gravity conditions (data not shown). These results suggested that the cells were defective in cytoskeleton formation, which might limit the formation of viable daughter cells. Cell wall structure analysis was then performed for the IF6SW-B1 T strain using TEM data. A simple comparison of the cell wall thickness of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity ( Figure 4 A,B) with simulated microgravity ( Figure 4 E, F) conditions exhibited enormous size (~5×) differences and substantiated the confocal microscopy-based measurements. Comparison of confocal, SEM, and TEM ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 and Figure 4 ) between the three different conditions indicated that the µG grown Titan-like cells were much larger and exhibited irregular morphologies, including the novel discovery of peeling and shedding bud scars ( Figure 3 D, Figure 4 E, and Figure S8A–G ). Indeed, a large majority of the disfigurement and abnormal cell morphology appeared to be associated with the surface location where daughter cell replication occurred ( Figure 3 C,D and Figure S8A–C ). Further analyses of TEM images emphasized the differences between the growth conditions, with µG grown cells showing large structural alterations within the intracellular space, having thicker cell walls, and a decrease in the amount of surface-associated fimbria ( Figure 4 E,F). Fimbria have been shown to play roles in both biofilm formation [ 60 ] and pathogenesis [ 61 ]; thus, the modifications seen in µG grown cell fimbria could alter both biofilm formation and pathogenesis. The increased cell wall thickness of the µG grown cells could impart resistance to osmotic shock or add protection against radiation exposure. These structural alterations seen in TEM are a direct stress response to the microgravity and elevated CO 2 conditions, and they could possibly serve to benefit (or hinder) the yeast cell’s survivability in the spaceflight environment. Additionally, the µG grown cells showed irregular intracellular organization with what appears to be large unknown membrane bound compartments/structures ( Figure 4 E). The function and content of these structures is still unclear, and it is currently unknown if these are vacuole or lysome-like vacuoles ( Figure 4 E) [ 62 ]. Previous reports have shown that some yeast can produce large numbers of compounds that are subsequently stored in vacuoles, while other yeast can utilize these large storage vesicles to degrade a large variety of substances [ 62 , 63 ]. Increased vacuole size could suggest a larger assortment and or quantity of nutrients being degraded by the Titan-like cells than by the standard gravity grown cells. Additionally, research has shown that portions of vacuoles can be passed to daughter cells [ 64 ]. Thus, it is possible that simulated microgravity induced compounds contained in the vacuoles may be passed to their progeny. Much further work is needed to better identify novel structures within the Titan-like cells, categorize the specific modifications that are occurring to organelles within the cells, determine how each of the cellular modifications alters the cells’ survivability in extreme environments (pH ranges, temperature ranges, osmotic shock, radiation exposure, etc.), and determine if these traits are passed on to their progeny. Cryptococcus species have been shown to produce enlarged Titan-like cells to adapt to stress and contribute to Cryptococcus pathogenesis [ 20 , 65 ]. Both functions may also be of relevance for these ISS strains. The polyploidy nature of the yeast cells should be investigated as this might shed insights into the adaptation of these cells to microgravity conditions. Even though confocal microscopy measurements and increased fluorescence content in the microgravity-grown cells were documented, analysis of the nucleic acid reads of heterozygous regions of the genomes and a comparison of the ratios for the various alleles is needed to confirm the polyploidy nature of these cells. It is documented in C. neoformans that the enlarged polyploid Titan-like cells were able to generate progeny with aneuploidy. It was additionally found that the progeny of these Titan-like cells have both growth and survival advantages over typical cell progeny under stressful conditions [ 20 ]. Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1 T yeast to space conditions [ 20 ]. While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISS Naganishia species is novel. Understanding how microgravity influences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence in Naganishia species and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aide Cryptococcus cells evade the immune system [ 21 , 26 , 65 , 66 , 67 ]. By growing from the normal range of ~1 to 3 μm in diameter to >10 μm, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progeny’s increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to confirm this aspect. 3.3. Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain Using BLAST, genes in ISS Naganishia species were compared to known genes that conferred resistance to cold, microgravity, and radiation ( Table 1 ), as well as pigment biosynthesis. The reference genes were a compilation of NCBI queries and previously reported genes related to the spaceflight-related characteristics ( Table 1 ). In addition to our four N. tulchinskyi strains, N. vishniacii (Antarctica strain), Papiliotrema laurentii (ISS isolates), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (space flown strain) were included for comparison. A total of 24 genes aligned to one or more of the assemblies. Genes related to pigment synthesis and radioresistance were among the most prevalent, while genes associated with microgravity were mostly exclusive of S. cerevisiae . Proteome prediction was performed with MAKER to determine biotechnologically important genetic elements in the four novel Naganishia strains [ 31 ]. Protein-coding genes were then assigned gene ontologies (GO) using InterProScan [ 68 ] ( Figure 5 ) and passed through REVIGO [ 58 ] to summarize GO assignments and remove redundant terms ( Figure S1 ). In total, 4894 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled draft genomes, which comprised 128 scaffolds ( Supplemental Table S1 ). A total of 86, 47, and 89 top ontological hits were assigned, respectively, for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function ( Table S1 ), ranked by ontological uniqueness of term with respect to all other terms cataloged in UniProt. Top Biological Processes include cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, reflecting a repertoire that was suited to respond to microgravity and radiation ( Figure 5 and Figure S2 ). The extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were top cellular component results, implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the top molecular function hits included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Changing these molecular mechanisms can alter the shape of cells, and in fungi, morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli have been reported and mostly attributed to pathogenesis [ 20 , 69 ]. The highest ontological hits revealed the presence of protein coding genes that might provide insights into the underlying origins of Titan-like cells in N. tulchinskyi . However, more studies are necessary to depict the mechanisms and role of titanization in microgravity. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Enriched GOSlim terms for biological process, cellular components, and molecular function in N. tulchinskyi genome. The Gene Ontology terms were summarized by purging redundant GO terms that were deduced by orthologous searches coupled with semantic similarity-based scatterplots using the REVIGO platform [ 58 ]. The ability of Naganishia species to grow at low temperatures [ 29 ] and withstand high doses of UV radiation in extreme environments [ 1 ] has led to the ongoing microbial characterization of this genus; however, there are currently only a few genomes publicly available [ 70 , 71 ]. Unlike the S. cerevisiae genome, which has been extensively studied [ 72 ], the genomic characterization of the Naganishia clade is still in its infancy. The presence of reported genes related to cold resistance [ 39 ], radiation tolerance [ 47 ], and microgravity ( Table 1 ) in ISS strains might indicate the potential of the novel N. tulchinskyi to better withstand the ISS or spaceflight-related conditions. However, only a few genes associated with microgravity have been identified [ 73 , 74 ]. It has been reported that the RAD51 , RAD54 , and RDH54 genes seen in ISS strains also play critical roles in C. neoformans to repair gamma-radiation induced DNA damage [ 47 ]. Additionally, high carotenoid concentration has been correlated with an increased resistance of the cells against freeze damage, environmental stress, and radiation protection [ 75 , 76 ], all of which are notable features of the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans [ 77 , 78 ]. Biomolecules responsible for the pigment biosynthesis, such as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, cytochrome P450 reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, and NTH1, putative trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps2 were present in all strains of Naganishia and S. cerevisiae ( Table 1 ). It has been well documented that carotenoids can efficiently protect the skin from UV-light induced damages, scavenging singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals [ 79 ]. The microbiological synthesis of carotenoids, significance, and biotechnological relevance were extensively reviewed [ 80 ]. The phytoene-beta carotene synthase ( pbs ) was present only in ISS strains but not found in S. cerevisiae. More research is needed here since biosynthesis of tetraterpenoids and pbs involvement in microorganisms is still poorly understood [ 81 ]. 3.4. Taxonomy Novel species: Naganishia tulchinskyi, N. K. Singh and K. Venkateswaran, sp. nov. MycoBank number: MB838832. Etymology : Naganishia tulchinskyi (tul.chin. s’ky.i. N.L. gen. n. tulchinskyi named after Igor Tulchinsky, an American Philanthropist supporting biomedical, computational, and space research). Diagnosis : Based on the morphological characteristics, strains IF6SW-B1 T , IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1 are similar to N. albida group, but phylogenetically distant from all known Naganishia species. Hyphae and pseudohyphae were not present, sexual reproduction was not observed, budding cells were present and ballistoconidia were absent. Type strain : IF6SW-B1 T. Holotype : USA: International Space Station surfaces, March 15, 2015. Nitin K. Singh and Kasthuri Venkateswaran, ex-type living culture (IF6SW-B1 T ) was preserved in a metabolically inactive state at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL 64202) and at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSM 113487). Description : In PDA medium after 5 days at 25 °C, the cells are round, ovoid to ellipsoidal, 4.1 ± 0.97 μm and occur singly with polar budding. When grown under simulated microgravity at 30 °C, cells are ~3 times larger and formed Titan-like cells ( Figure 2 ). After incubation at 25 °C, the streak culture on PDA agar is butyrous and cream colored, with a smooth surface and an entire margin. Growth occurs at 4, 25, and 30 °C and not at 35 °C on nutrient medium. Biochemical characteristics: Differential biochemical characteristics of N. tulchinskyi with other closely related Naganishia species are shown in Table 3 . N. tulchinskyi strains are able to assimilate D-Arabinose, D-Ribose, L-Sorbose, D-Mannitol, α-D-Glucose, L-Arabinose, Salicin, D-Trehalose, Maltose, D-Xylose, Sucrose, D-Cellobiose, Succinic Acid Mono-Methyl Ester, D-Xylose, and Palatinose as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells did not utilize Cellobiose, Arbutin, D-Galactose, Glycerol, Hexadecane, L-Malic acid, L-Rhamnose, Lactose, Mannitol, Melezitose, Methyl a-glucoside, Myo-inositol, Raffinose, Xylitol, Citrate, Melibiose, Meso erythritol, Glucono D-lactone, Inulin, and N-acetyl D-glucosamine as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells assimilate D-arabinose and can be differentiated from N. friedmannii, N. saitoi, N. globosa. Similarly, several carbon substrates are differentially utilized by N. tulchinskyi and are detailed in Table 3 . Table 3.

The type strain IF6SW-B1 T and two other strains (IF7SW-B1 and IF1SW-F1) were isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015), while the fourth strain (IIF5SW-F1) was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015). Strain IF6SW-B1 T was isolated from a rack that contained crew clothes, crew preference items, office supplies, and ISS medical accessory kits (Location #6, Permanent Multipurpose Module Port 1). The second strain IF7SW-B1 was isolated from a rack being used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS (Location #7, Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1). The third strain IF1SW-F1 was isolated from a viewing port in a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities (Location #1, Port panel of the Cupola). The fourth strain IIF5SW-F1 was the only strain in this study isolated during Flight 2, and it was cultivated from a storage rack made up of Nomex fabrics and used as a pantry to store batteries, printer cartridges, office supplies, etc. (Location #5, Overhead-4, Node 1, US module). Distribution : This novel species has yet to be found in any samples from other Earth environments. Material examined : The particulate matter associated with 1 m 2 surface area of the ISS environmental surfaces was examined.",
    "Conclusion": "Several yeast strains belonging to the Naganishia ( Cryptococcus ) diffluens clade of Filobasidiales were isolated from two different flight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS [ 5 ]. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1 T , IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identified to be novel species belonging to the genus Naganishia, based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations #1, #2, and #3), Node 1 (Locations #4 and #5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location #6), U.S. Laboratory (Location #7), and Node 2 (Locations #8 and control). A detailed description of the various locations sampled was published elsewhere [ 59 ]. Strains IF6SW-B1, IF7SW-B1, and IF1SW-F1, were isolated during first sampling from Locations 6, 7, and 1, respectively. Strain IIF5SW-F1 was isolated from second sampling at Location 5. 3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Naganishia . The MycoBank database documented 19 Naganishia species, and the CBS database showed only 11 Naganishia species. The gene sequences available on NCBI for Naganishia species ( n = 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees with C. neoformans CBS 132 strain as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II ( RPB1 and RPB2 ), translation elongation factor 1-α ( TEF1 ), and cytochrome b ( CYTB ), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species [ 2 ]. The respective gene sequences that were available on NCBI for different Naganishia species were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members from Tremellomycetes ( Goffeauzyma gastricus CBS 2288 ( AF145323.1 ), Heterocephalacria arrabidensis CBS 8678 ( AF444362.2 ), Piskurozyma cylindrica CBS 8680 ( AF444360.1 ), Solicoccozyma aerius CBS155 ( AF145324.1 ), and Tremella mesenterica CBS 6973 ( AF444433.1 )) were included with Cryptococcus neoformans CBS 132 ( AF444326.1 ) as the outgroup. Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB , RPB1 , RPB2 , and TEF1 genes were generated and are presented in Supplemental Figures S1–S7 . When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no significant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences ( Figure S3 ), whereas the other four genes ( CYTB , RPB1 , RPB2 , and TEF1 ) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all the Naganishia species. The ITS tree ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species, N. diffluens, N. liquefaciens and N. albidosimilis . ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100% similarity to the sequence of N. albidosimilis CBS 7711 T ( AF145325 ), N. liquefaciens CBS 968 T ( AF444345 ), and N. diffluens CBS 160 T ( AF145330 ). However, ITS sequences of N. vishniacii CBS 7110 T shared 97.84% similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145320 .), N. uzbekistanensis CBS 8683 T had 97.55% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF444339 ), and N. adeliensis CBS 8351 T exhibited 97.34% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145328 ) with ISS isolates ( Supplemental Figure S1 ). In the LSU tree ( Supplemental Figure S2 ), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished from N. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii , and N. albidosimilis with low bootstrap support. Comparing the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71% similarity to N. albida (type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075474 ), 96.41% similarity to N. albidosimilis (type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF137601 ), 96.25% similarly to N. liquefaciens (type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF181515 ), and 95.92% similarity to N. diffluens (type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075502 ) ( Supplemental Figure S2 ). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51% in the LSU region and 99.21% in the ITS region [ 1 ]. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates confirm they belong to a new species in the genus Naganishia (order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species. The other phylogenetic trees based on CYTB , RPB1 , RPB2 , and TEF1 grouped the ISS strains together, and the closest neighbor was identified as N. diffluens . Subsequently, MLST was carried out by manually concatenating the seven genes ( Figure 1 ). The MLST phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the same clade with N. diffluens CBS 160 T ( Figure 1 ). The individual gene-based and MLST tree-based analyses both further supported the finding that the four ISS strains belong to the same species which is closely related to, but separate from, N. diffluens . This suggested that the four ISS strains were novel species of the genus Naganishia . All four strains were isolated during different flights and sampling sessions at various locations, suggesting that these isolates are not clonal but persisting in the ISS environment. The ecological significance of this finding, in the closed system aboard the ISS warrants, further study. The genomes of four ISS strains were sequenced, draft genome was assembled, annotated, and the results were published elsewhere [ 6 ]. The genome size was ~19.4 Mbp with GC content between 53–56%, similar to other members of the genus Naganishia . Figure 1.

Titan-like Cell Characterization of Novel ISS Strains IF6SW-B1 T strain was grown under culture conditions similar to those used for titanization of C. neoformans , and analyzed using a variety of microscopy techniques. Cell size and cell wall thickness were determined using Calcofluor White stain ( Figure 2 ), Titan-like cell morphology using SEM ( Figure 3 ), and cell wall structure using TEM ( Figure 4 ). The Calcofluor White Stain ( Figure 2 A) binds with chitin contained within cell walls, and once triggered by its excitation wavelength (380 nm), the stain fluoresces and emits blue light at 475 nm. Bright-field images were captured alongside Calcofluor White images to show cell distribution and confirm successful Calcofluor White staining, while Calcofluor White micrographs were used to measure the size of the cells and their thickness ( Figure 2 A). Figure 2 B shows the cell size in diameter (µm) under various growth conditions, whereas Figure 2 C depicts the cell wall thickness. The size of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity conditions and in the presence of 5% CO 2 with standard Earth gravity ranged from 2.5 µm to 6 µm; however, the cells grown under 5% CO 2 were statistically significantly larger ( p ≤ 0.05). When the strain was grown under 5% CO 2 and simulated microgravity (µG) conditions, the cell size increased at least two to three times in size (4 µm to 13 µm; mean increased size of ~10 µm) and was statistically significantly larger than both the standard gravity control ( p ≤ 0.0001) and the 5% CO 2 treatment ( p ≤ 0.0001) ( Figure 2 B). There was no statistical difference for cell wall thickness between the standard gravity control and the 5% CO 2 grow cells (ns). However, the cell wall thickness was two to three-times larger when cells were grown under simulated microgravity conditions compared with the other two culture conditions (0.55 µm and 0.40–0.39 µm, respectively), these findings were statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.0001) ( Figure 2 C). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Confocal microscope-based analyses of N. tulchinskyi cells when grown under standard Earth gravity (SD), normal gravity with 5% CO 2 (CO), and simulated microgravity with 5% CO 2 (µG). Representative images of Calcofluor White cell wall-stained cells adjacent to bright field images are shown in ( A ). The µG cells appear to be larger and misshapen when compared to the typical yeast morphology demonstrated by SD and CO. Measurements for cell diameter were taken using the of Calcofluor White confocal images ( B ). Though smaller than µG cells, SD cells were statically smaller in cell size than CO cells ( p value = 0.0440), while µG cells were statistically significantly larger than both SD and CO cells ( p value ≤ 0.0001). Cell wall thickness was also measured using confocal microscopy ( C ). Cell wall thickness of SD and CO were not statistically different in size ( p value ≥ 0.9999); however, µG cells had statistically significantly larger cell walls than both SD and CO cells ( p value ≤ 0.0001). The scale bars for both confocal and bright field microscopic images is 40 µm. Statistical significance is reported as p value > 0.05 (ns), ≤0.05 (*), ≤0.01 (**), ≤0.001 (***), ≤0.0001 (****). p values of ≤0.01 (**) and ≤0.001 (***) were not noticed. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Analyses of scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of SD, CO, and µG grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in conidia size, morphology, and daughter cell budding. SD ( A ) and CO ( B ) grown cells demonstrated similar standard yeast morphotypes, while µG ( C , D ) grown cells are larger, nonuniform in appearance, and exhibit random budding scars. In some instances, the µG budding scars have raised centers, while others appear to be concave. Additionally, some budding scars appear to be shedding or peeling from the surface of the cells. This phenomenon is highlighted with the white arrow ( D ). Representative SEM micrographs are given, and scale bar for all micrographs is 10 µm. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Analyses of transmission electron microscope (TEM) micrographs of SD ( A , B ), CO ( C , D ), and µG ( E , F ) grown N. tulchinskyi cells demonstrated differences in cell size, cell wall thickness, and internal organelle structures. SD and CO demonstrate similar size cells and similar intracellular morphology, while µG grown cells appear to have a different internal organizational structure of organelles. At higher magnifications (lower panels), the cell wall thickness can be seen to be thicker for µG grown cells than for SD or CO grown cells. The cells also appear to be having lower abundance of fine scale fimbriae on the surface of µG cells, as compared to SD and CO grown cells. Along with their large size, the µG grown cells are distinguished by the shedding and peeling bud scars from their surfaces, denoted by white arrows ( C ). Additionally, µG grown cells have the presence of large unknown organelles/structures, as denoted by the black arrow. Representative TEM micrographs are given. The scale bar for ( A , C , E ) is 1 µm, and the scale bare for ( B , D , F ) is 0.2 µm. The budding scars in IF6SW-B1 T strain seemed to exhibit normal bipolar budding pattern when grown under standard gravity ( Figure 3 A) and when grown and exposed to 5% CO 2 with standard Earth gravity ( Figure 3 B). However, when the strain is grown under simulated microgravity and 5% CO 2 conditions, multilateral budding is seen ( Figure 3 C,D). In addition, the budding cells were not as predominant under microgravity as those grown under normal gravity conditions ( Figure 3 A). Finally, when the IF6SW-B1 T strain was grown under 5% CO 2 , as well as simulated microgravity ( Figure 3 C,D) conditions, observations of budding cells were much less commonly observed, whereas the budding scars were evident and appeared to take up a larger proportional area on the yeast cell surface. The budding scars under simulated microgravity conditions range in morphology and size from 2–3 µm raised prominences extending 1–2 µm from the cell surface to large flat raised rings up to 5 µm in diameter ( Figure 3 C,D). Despite these morphological differences, microgravity grown yeast cells were viable when re-streaked onto a PDA plate. Comparatively, the number of viable cells was less when grown under 5% CO 2 and simulated microgravity compared to the other standard atmosphere and gravity conditions (data not shown). These results suggested that the cells were defective in cytoskeleton formation, which might limit the formation of viable daughter cells. Cell wall structure analysis was then performed for the IF6SW-B1 T strain using TEM data. A simple comparison of the cell wall thickness of the cells grown under standard Earth gravity ( Figure 4 A,B) with simulated microgravity ( Figure 4 E, F) conditions exhibited enormous size (~5×) differences and substantiated the confocal microscopy-based measurements. Comparison of confocal, SEM, and TEM ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 and Figure 4 ) between the three different conditions indicated that the µG grown Titan-like cells were much larger and exhibited irregular morphologies, including the novel discovery of peeling and shedding bud scars ( Figure 3 D, Figure 4 E, and Figure S8A–G ). Indeed, a large majority of the disfigurement and abnormal cell morphology appeared to be associated with the surface location where daughter cell replication occurred ( Figure 3 C,D and Figure S8A–C ). Further analyses of TEM images emphasized the differences between the growth conditions, with µG grown cells showing large structural alterations within the intracellular space, having thicker cell walls, and a decrease in the amount of surface-associated fimbria ( Figure 4 E,F). Fimbria have been shown to play roles in both biofilm formation [ 60 ] and pathogenesis [ 61 ]; thus, the modifications seen in µG grown cell fimbria could alter both biofilm formation and pathogenesis. The increased cell wall thickness of the µG grown cells could impart resistance to osmotic shock or add protection against radiation exposure. These structural alterations seen in TEM are a direct stress response to the microgravity and elevated CO 2 conditions, and they could possibly serve to benefit (or hinder) the yeast cell’s survivability in the spaceflight environment. Additionally, the µG grown cells showed irregular intracellular organization with what appears to be large unknown membrane bound compartments/structures ( Figure 4 E). The function and content of these structures is still unclear, and it is currently unknown if these are vacuole or lysome-like vacuoles ( Figure 4 E) [ 62 ]. Previous reports have shown that some yeast can produce large numbers of compounds that are subsequently stored in vacuoles, while other yeast can utilize these large storage vesicles to degrade a large variety of substances [ 62 , 63 ]. Increased vacuole size could suggest a larger assortment and or quantity of nutrients being degraded by the Titan-like cells than by the standard gravity grown cells. Additionally, research has shown that portions of vacuoles can be passed to daughter cells [ 64 ]. Thus, it is possible that simulated microgravity induced compounds contained in the vacuoles may be passed to their progeny. Much further work is needed to better identify novel structures within the Titan-like cells, categorize the specific modifications that are occurring to organelles within the cells, determine how each of the cellular modifications alters the cells’ survivability in extreme environments (pH ranges, temperature ranges, osmotic shock, radiation exposure, etc.), and determine if these traits are passed on to their progeny. Cryptococcus species have been shown to produce enlarged Titan-like cells to adapt to stress and contribute to Cryptococcus pathogenesis [ 20 , 65 ]. Both functions may also be of relevance for these ISS strains. The polyploidy nature of the yeast cells should be investigated as this might shed insights into the adaptation of these cells to microgravity conditions. Even though confocal microscopy measurements and increased fluorescence content in the microgravity-grown cells were documented, analysis of the nucleic acid reads of heterozygous regions of the genomes and a comparison of the ratios for the various alleles is needed to confirm the polyploidy nature of these cells. It is documented in C. neoformans that the enlarged polyploid Titan-like cells were able to generate progeny with aneuploidy. It was additionally found that the progeny of these Titan-like cells have both growth and survival advantages over typical cell progeny under stressful conditions [ 20 ]. Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1 T yeast to space conditions [ 20 ]. While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISS Naganishia species is novel. Understanding how microgravity influences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence in Naganishia species and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aide Cryptococcus cells evade the immune system [ 21 , 26 , 65 , 66 , 67 ]. By growing from the normal range of ~1 to 3 μm in diameter to >10 μm, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progeny’s increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to confirm this aspect. 3.3. Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain Using BLAST, genes in ISS Naganishia species were compared to known genes that conferred resistance to cold, microgravity, and radiation ( Table 1 ), as well as pigment biosynthesis. The reference genes were a compilation of NCBI queries and previously reported genes related to the spaceflight-related characteristics ( Table 1 ). In addition to our four N. tulchinskyi strains, N. vishniacii (Antarctica strain), Papiliotrema laurentii (ISS isolates), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (space flown strain) were included for comparison. A total of 24 genes aligned to one or more of the assemblies. Genes related to pigment synthesis and radioresistance were among the most prevalent, while genes associated with microgravity were mostly exclusive of S. cerevisiae . Proteome prediction was performed with MAKER to determine biotechnologically important genetic elements in the four novel Naganishia strains [ 31 ]. Protein-coding genes were then assigned gene ontologies (GO) using InterProScan [ 68 ] ( Figure 5 ) and passed through REVIGO [ 58 ] to summarize GO assignments and remove redundant terms ( Figure S1 ). In total, 4894 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled draft genomes, which comprised 128 scaffolds ( Supplemental Table S1 ). A total of 86, 47, and 89 top ontological hits were assigned, respectively, for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function ( Table S1 ), ranked by ontological uniqueness of term with respect to all other terms cataloged in UniProt. Top Biological Processes include cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, reflecting a repertoire that was suited to respond to microgravity and radiation ( Figure 5 and Figure S2 ). The extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were top cellular component results, implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the top molecular function hits included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Changing these molecular mechanisms can alter the shape of cells, and in fungi, morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli have been reported and mostly attributed to pathogenesis [ 20 , 69 ]. The highest ontological hits revealed the presence of protein coding genes that might provide insights into the underlying origins of Titan-like cells in N. tulchinskyi . However, more studies are necessary to depict the mechanisms and role of titanization in microgravity. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Enriched GOSlim terms for biological process, cellular components, and molecular function in N. tulchinskyi genome. The Gene Ontology terms were summarized by purging redundant GO terms that were deduced by orthologous searches coupled with semantic similarity-based scatterplots using the REVIGO platform [ 58 ]. The ability of Naganishia species to grow at low temperatures [ 29 ] and withstand high doses of UV radiation in extreme environments [ 1 ] has led to the ongoing microbial characterization of this genus; however, there are currently only a few genomes publicly available [ 70 , 71 ]. Unlike the S. cerevisiae genome, which has been extensively studied [ 72 ], the genomic characterization of the Naganishia clade is still in its infancy. The presence of reported genes related to cold resistance [ 39 ], radiation tolerance [ 47 ], and microgravity ( Table 1 ) in ISS strains might indicate the potential of the novel N. tulchinskyi to better withstand the ISS or spaceflight-related conditions. However, only a few genes associated with microgravity have been identified [ 73 , 74 ]. It has been reported that the RAD51 , RAD54 , and RDH54 genes seen in ISS strains also play critical roles in C. neoformans to repair gamma-radiation induced DNA damage [ 47 ]. Additionally, high carotenoid concentration has been correlated with an increased resistance of the cells against freeze damage, environmental stress, and radiation protection [ 75 , 76 ], all of which are notable features of the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans [ 77 , 78 ]. Biomolecules responsible for the pigment biosynthesis, such as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, cytochrome P450 reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase, alpha, alpha-trehalase NTH2, and NTH1, putative trehalose-phosphate synthase Tps2 were present in all strains of Naganishia and S. cerevisiae ( Table 1 ). It has been well documented that carotenoids can efficiently protect the skin from UV-light induced damages, scavenging singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals [ 79 ]. The microbiological synthesis of carotenoids, significance, and biotechnological relevance were extensively reviewed [ 80 ]. The phytoene-beta carotene synthase ( pbs ) was present only in ISS strains but not found in S. cerevisiae. More research is needed here since biosynthesis of tetraterpenoids and pbs involvement in microorganisms is still poorly understood [ 81 ]. 3.4. Taxonomy Novel species: Naganishia tulchinskyi, N. K. Singh and K. Venkateswaran, sp. nov. MycoBank number: MB838832. Etymology : Naganishia tulchinskyi (tul.chin. s’ky.i. N.L. gen. n. tulchinskyi named after Igor Tulchinsky, an American Philanthropist supporting biomedical, computational, and space research). Diagnosis : Based on the morphological characteristics, strains IF6SW-B1 T , IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1 are similar to N. albida group, but phylogenetically distant from all known Naganishia species. Hyphae and pseudohyphae were not present, sexual reproduction was not observed, budding cells were present and ballistoconidia were absent. Type strain : IF6SW-B1 T. Holotype : USA: International Space Station surfaces, March 15, 2015. Nitin K. Singh and Kasthuri Venkateswaran, ex-type living culture (IF6SW-B1 T ) was preserved in a metabolically inactive state at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory (NRRL 64202) and at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSM 113487). Description : In PDA medium after 5 days at 25 °C, the cells are round, ovoid to ellipsoidal, 4.1 ± 0.97 μm and occur singly with polar budding. When grown under simulated microgravity at 30 °C, cells are ~3 times larger and formed Titan-like cells ( Figure 2 ). After incubation at 25 °C, the streak culture on PDA agar is butyrous and cream colored, with a smooth surface and an entire margin. Growth occurs at 4, 25, and 30 °C and not at 35 °C on nutrient medium. Biochemical characteristics: Differential biochemical characteristics of N. tulchinskyi with other closely related Naganishia species are shown in Table 3 . N. tulchinskyi strains are able to assimilate D-Arabinose, D-Ribose, L-Sorbose, D-Mannitol, α-D-Glucose, L-Arabinose, Salicin, D-Trehalose, Maltose, D-Xylose, Sucrose, D-Cellobiose, Succinic Acid Mono-Methyl Ester, D-Xylose, and Palatinose as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells did not utilize Cellobiose, Arbutin, D-Galactose, Glycerol, Hexadecane, L-Malic acid, L-Rhamnose, Lactose, Mannitol, Melezitose, Methyl a-glucoside, Myo-inositol, Raffinose, Xylitol, Citrate, Melibiose, Meso erythritol, Glucono D-lactone, Inulin, and N-acetyl D-glucosamine as sole carbon source. N. tulchinskyi cells assimilate D-arabinose and can be differentiated from N. friedmannii, N. saitoi, N. globosa. Similarly, several carbon substrates are differentially utilized by N. tulchinskyi and are detailed in Table 3 . Table 3.

The type strain IF6SW-B1 T and two other strains (IF7SW-B1 and IF1SW-F1) were isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015), while the fourth strain (IIF5SW-F1) was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015). Strain IF6SW-B1 T was isolated from a rack that contained crew clothes, crew preference items, office supplies, and ISS medical accessory kits (Location #6, Permanent Multipurpose Module Port 1). The second strain IF7SW-B1 was isolated from a rack being used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS (Location #7, Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1). The third strain IF1SW-F1 was isolated from a viewing port in a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities (Location #1, Port panel of the Cupola). The fourth strain IIF5SW-F1 was the only strain in this study isolated during Flight 2, and it was cultivated from a storage rack made up of Nomex fabrics and used as a pantry to store batteries, printer cartridges, office supplies, etc. (Location #5, Overhead-4, Node 1, US module). Distribution : This novel species has yet to be found in any samples from other Earth environments. Material examined : The particulate matter associated with 1 m 2 surface area of the ISS environmental surfaces was examined.",
