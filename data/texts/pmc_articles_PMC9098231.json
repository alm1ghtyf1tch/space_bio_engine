    "Results": "Genome variation among ISS-grown samples To identify genomic alterations occurring in A. nidulans strains in response to ISS conditions, whole genome paired-end sequencing (WGS) was performed on ISS-grown samples and ground-grown control strains, which were subjected to growth for 7 days. Reads were aligned to the FGSC A4 reference genome and any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in ground controls were removed from each strain’s sample set, which resulted in the removal of 208, 194, 231, and 224 SNPs from the FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001, respectively. This revealed 129, 136, 108, and 106 SNPs, and 36, 39, 41, and 31 INDELs in ISS-grown FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001, respectively, that occurred in ISS-grown samples when compared to ground controls, the features of which are displayed in Table 1 . All identified SNPs and INDELs are summarized in Supplementary Tables S3 – 6 , presenting FGSC A4, LO1362, LO8158, and CW12001, respectively. The total number of missense mutations observed in ISS-grown strains ranged from 9 to 15 for each strain’s sample set. These mutations were observed within only 5 protein-coding genes, with the same mutation often present in multiple samples ( Table 2 ). A total of 13 unique missense base mutations were observed within AN5254, which encodes a protein containing domains predicted to be involved in RNA binding and RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity. Two unique mutations that resulted in premature stop codon were also observed within AN5254, one of which occurred in both the 4- and 7-day LO8158 and CW12001 ISS-grown samples. The remaining missense mutations occurred within AN0532, AN0535, AN0537, and AN0538, which are within a few genes away from one another in the genome. AN0532 encodes a predicted DDE1 transposable element gene, while the products of AN05235, AN0537, and AN0538 are uncharacterized. In both CW12001 ISS-grown samples, identical mutations that resulted in the loss of the original stop codon were observed within the laeA (AN0807) gene. The same frameshift stop-gain mutation independently occurred in all space-grown LO1362 and LO8158 samples within the mnpA gene (AN10311) ( Supplementary Tables S4 – 5 ), which encodes a hyphal cell wall mannoprotein that may influence the surface structure ( Jeong et al. 2004 ).

Most intergenic SNPs were clustered nearby several specific genes and did not appear to be strain specific ( Supplementary Tables S3 – 6 ). Among all strains, many intergenic SNPs occurred near genes involved in transcription and translation, including the putative C6 transcription factor AN4972, the transcription elongation factor AN11131, the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein AN4298, the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase AN10829 with a predicted role in translational read-through, and AN6968 which is predicted to have RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity. Intergenic SNPs were also clustered nearby the putative alanine-tRNA ligase AN9419, the putative C4 sterol methyl oxidase AN6973 which has a predicted role in sterol metabolism, and AN9410 which has a predicted role in lipid metabolic processes. Intergenic SNPs were also observed near AN0538 and AN0539, which are within the uncharacterized cluster of genes that were reported above to possess high numbers of missense mutations. Most of the remaining intergenic SNPs occurred near AN6972, AN7848, AN10328, and AN11577, the products of which remain uncharacterized. Proteomic profiling of ISS-grown A. nidulans To investigate alterations in the proteome of A. nidulans strains following growth on the ISS, total protein was extracted from two biological replicates of each ISS-grown sample and Earth-grown counterpart. All samples were subjected to tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and LC-MS analysis. The resulting MS data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer with the Sequest-HT search engine against the A. nidulans FGSC A4 protein database (NCBI). The abundance ratios for all ISS-grown samples were normalized to their Earth-grown counterparts ( Supplementary Table S7 , 4-day samples; Supplemental Table S8 , 7-day samples), which led to the identification of up- and down-regulated proteins (fold-change (FC) >∣2∣, P < 0.05) in response to the ISS environment ( Fig. 2a ). Interestingly, only two proteins, QutC (AN1140), which is involved in quinic acid utilization, and AN2704, a putative aryl-alcohol oxidase-related protein, were up-regulated in A. nidulans WT strain. The number of proteins up-regulated and down-regulated in the three ISS-grown mutant strains ranged from 4 to 28, and 2 to 77, respectively, of 10,525 predicted proteins in A. nidulans FGSC A4 in total. Distribution of AspGD Gene Ontology (GO) Slim terms ( Arnaud et al. 2010 ) among the differentially expressed proteins for ISS-grown mutant strains is displayed in Fig. 2b – d . The GO Slim categories that possessed the highest number of differentially expressed proteins in LO1362 were stress response and carbohydrate metabolic processes. Similarly, in both LO8158 and CW12001, most differentially expressed proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Fig. 2.

Differentially expressed proteins in b LO1362, c LO8158, and d CW12001 were mapped to terms representing various biological processes using AspGD Gene Ontology (GO) Slim Mapper. Our study revealed differential abundance of proteins involved in the A. nidulans stress response following growth on the ISS ( Table 3 ). The heat shock protein Hsp20 (AN10507) was highly affected by ISS conditions, displaying a twofold and fourfold increase in protein abundance in LO1362 and CW12001, respectively, and a twofold decrease in protein abundance in LO8158. Induction of Hsp20 has been reported following exposure to osmotic stress in A. nidulans ( Wu et al. 2016 ). Conversely, the osmotic stress response protein CipB (AN7895) was down-regulated in LO1362 and the chaperone/heat shock protein Awh11 (AN3725) was down-regulated in LO1362 and LO8158. Differential abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response was observed among all ISS-grown strains relative to Earth-grown counterparts. The glutathione S-transferase GstB (AN6024), which has been reported to be significantly induced in response to menadione-induced oxidative stress ( Pusztahelyi et al. 2011 ), was up-regulated over twofold in LO8158, but down-regulated 1.7-fold and 1.8-fold in LO1362 and CW12001, respectively, after 7 days of growth on the ISS. Two catalase, CatA (AN8637) and AN8553, exhibited decreased protein abundance in LO8158 and increased protein abundance in CW12001. Similarly, both the nitrosative stress response protein AN2470 and the menadione stress-induced protein AN5564 were down-regulated approximately threefold in LO8158 and upregulated approximately 1.7-fold in CW12001. Up-regulation was observed for phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C AN3636 whose ortholog plays a major role in responding to nutrient deprivation in Candida albicans ( Uhl et al. 2003 ). Additionally, the GPI-anchored protein EcmA (AN4390) whose ortholog plays a major role in cell wall integrity, morphogenesis, and virulence, was up-regulated twofold in LO8158 after 7 days of growth on the ISS ( Martinez-Lopez et al. 2004 ).

Among all strains, proteins involved in secondary metabolism were differentially expressed in response to ISS conditions ( Table 3 ). The polyketide synthase AptA (AN6000), which is required for biosynthesis of the spore pigment asperthecin ( Szewczyk et al. 2008 ), was up-reguated over twofold in CW12001 and nearly twofold in FGSC A4 strain after 7 days of growth on the ISS. LO1362 also exhibited up-regulation of the monooxygenase MdpD (AN0147) after 7 days of growth. The MdpD protein is the product of a gene in the prenyl xanthone gene cluster, which is responsible for the production of monodictyphenone, emericellin, shamixanthone, and epishamixanthone ( Chiang et al. 2010 ; Sanchez et al. 2011 ). Interestingly, the opposite was observed in CW12001, as MdpJ (AN10038), which is the product of another gene in the prenyl xanthone gene cluster, exhibited decreased protein abundance in ISS-grown samples after 4 days. A similar trend was observed for proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the potent carcinogenic mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (ST) ( Fujii et al. 1976 ; Brown et al. 1996b ). ST gene cluster products AN7817 and StcN (AN7812) exhibited increased protein abundance in LO8158, while StcN was down-regulated in CW12001, following growth in ISS conditions. The proteome of ISS-grown A. nidulans samples also revealed differential levels of proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism when compared to Earth-grown controls ( Table 3 ). Many glycoside hydrolases involved in carbohydrate degradation processes were up-regulated more than twofold in ISS-grown LO8158 samples, including beta-1,4-endoglucanase AN8068 and beta-glucosidase BglM (AN7396), both of which are involved in cellulose degradation, alpha-arabinofuranosidase AbfC (AN1277), involved in pectin degradation, endo-1,4-beta-xylanase XlnC (AN1818), involved in xylan degradation, and beta-galactosidase LacA (AN0756), involved in xyloglucan, xylan, pectin, and galactomannan degradation. These glycoside hydrolases also exhibited decreased protein abundance in CW12001 when compared to ground counterparts. A similar trend was observed with alcohol oxidase AN0567, beta-glycosidase AN10124, ketose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase AN2334, dehydratase AN6035, and rhamnogalacturonan lyase RglA (AN7135), which were up-regulated at least twofold in ISS-grown LO8158 samples and down-regulated at least 1.5-fold in CW12001. Conversely, mannose-6-phosphate isomerase AN1715, isocitrate lyase AcuD (AN5634), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase AcuF (AN1918), and NAD+ dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase GfdB (AN6792) were down-regulated at least 2.5-fold in ISS-grown LO8158 samples and up-regulated at least 1.8-fold in CW12001 samples. Secondary metabolome alterations in ISS-grown A. nidulans Alterations in SM production of A. nidulans in response to ISS conditions were assessed by extracting SMs from three biological replicates of each ISS- and Earth-grown counterpart, and were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). All SMs were identified based on mass, UV absorption, and retention time, which led to the identification of austinol and dehydroaustinol ( Lo et al. 2012 ), terrequinone ( Bok et al. 2006 ), sterigmatocystin and its intermediate ( Brown et al. 1996a ), nidulanin A and its analogues ( Andersen et al. 2013 ), the emericellamides ( Chiang et al. 2008 ), the prenyl xanthones ( Sanchez et al. 2011 ), and asperthecin ( Sanchez et al. 2012 ) ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Relative differences in SM production levels of ISS-grown samples and Earth-grown counterparts were quantified by integrating the area under each SM’s EIC trace ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). ISS conditions induced asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001 after 7 days of growth, with production levels increased by over 300% and 150%, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). Production levels of prenyl xanthones decreased approximately fivefold in FGSC A4 ISS-grown samples ( Supplementary Fig. S3f ). In LO8158 samples, emericellamide and terrequinone production decreased ( Supplementary Fig. S3b & e ), while nidulanin and sterigmatocystin production increased in ISS grown samples ( Supplementary Fig. S3c & d ).

    "Conclusion": "Although the persistence of fungi within space vessels is well-documented and unavoidable ( Novikova 2004 ; Novikova et al. 2006 ; Checinska et al. 2015 ), little is understood about how fungi respond and adapt to spacecraft conditions, such as microgravity and enhanced radiation. To date, most microbiological studies conducted in such environments have focused on changes occurring within bacteria or the microbiome as a whole ( Tixador et al. 1985 ; Wilson et al. 2008 ; Checinska et al. 2015 ; Mora et al. 2016 ; Huang et al. 2018 ). Additionally, despite the various therapeutic and industrial applications of SMs, few studies have analyzed the global influence of space conditions on fungal secondary metabolism, as previous investigations have often focused on the production of a single SM ( Lam et al. 1998 ; Lam et al. 2002 ; Benoit et al. 2006 ). Therefore, with the duration of space missions expected to increase, a major goal of this study was to investigate space-induced alternations in fungal ‘omics’ to identify specific adaptation biomarkers and acquire insight into potential benefits of fungi that may not be discernable using traditional methodology. This study revealed that the spacecraft environment alters the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. Five protein-coding genes displayed signatures of positive selection in the form of a high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous SNPs across all ISS-grown samples. These data stand in agreement with a study that investigated genomic alterations occurring in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus during spaceflight, in which missense mutations were clustered and occurred within only 9 protein-coding genes ( Guo et al. 2015 ). High numbers of intergenic mutations were clustered near genes encoding transcriptional and translational machinery. One gene with several non-synonymous and two unique stop gain mutation encodes a putative retrotransposon, suggesting its suppression confers selective advantage during growth in spacecraft environments. Other missense and intergenic mutations were clustered within and around a specific region of the genome (AN0532-AN0538), suggesting that it underwent positive selection and therefore plays a role in adapting to the space environment. One of these genes also encoded an uncharacterized transposable element gene, underscoring the significance of alterations in transposable element activity in response to growth in ISS conditions. These findings are consistent with results from the aforementioned S. aureus study, as variations were also observed within a putative transposase ( Guo et al. 2015 ). Interestingly, transposable element activity has been associated with stress response due to the novel variation it introduces into the genome ( Capy et al. 2000 ). Future work should focus on characterizing the activities of the rest of these genes, as many of their functions remain unknown. Such knowledge may provide information key to elucidating the genetic adaptation mechanisms of fungi residing in spacecraft environments. Correlations linking genomic and proteomic data were observed with the two strains genetically engineered to increase SM production. Expsoure to the space environment appeared to curtail enhanced SM production in the laeA overexpression strain through the introduction of a point mutation that resulted in loss of the laeA stop codon, thereby activating nonstop decay degradation of laeA mRNA ( Hoof et al. 2002 ; Klauer and van Hoof 2012 ). The ISS-induced down-regulation of laeA was also observed in the proteome of those samples, which exhibited an expression profile opposite that of the mcrA deletion strain for many proteins. Proteins involved in SM biosynthesis pathways regulated by laeA exhibited decreased and increased abundance in ISS-grown CW12001 and LO8158, respectively. The extensively studied protein LaeA forms a nuclear complex with VeA and VelB that coordinates secondary metabolism regulation with fungal development ( Bayram et al. 2010 ). LaeA is often referred to as a global regulator of secondary metabolism ( Bok and Keller 2016 ), and has been reported to also influence proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative stress response ( Lv et al. 2018 ). Accordingly, several proteins involved in carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolic processes exhibited opposite protein expression profiles in LO8158 and CW12001. Regulation by laeA has been reported for some of these proteins in A. flavus , including endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, betaglycoside, endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, and oxidative stress response proteins CatA and GstB ( Lv et al. 2018 ). These findings verify the extensive regulatory role of laeA and highlight the complexity involved in identifying the laeA -controlled processes responsible for conferring selective advantage of the observed laeA stop lost mutation. This is compounded by reports that laeA also alters chromatin remodeling, cell growth and metabolism, conidiogenesis, conidialchain elongation, sporulation, pigmentation and colony hydrophobicity in various fungal species ( Kosalková et al. 2009 ; Chang et al. 2012 ; Brakhage 2013 ; Lv et al. 2018 ). It is also possible that curtailing laeA overexpression is favored in ISS conditions to reduce energy expenditures in a stressful environment. ISS conditions significantly increased production of asperthecin, an anthraquinone pigment, in LO1362 and CW12001. Both mutants are deficient in NkuA production, which facilitates non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair, the favored DNA double strand break repair pathway in filamentous fungi ( Krappmann 2007 ). We had anticipated that NkuA deficient strains would be particularly interesting in flight studies due to impairment of a preferred DNA repair pathway in a mutagenic, high-radiation environment. Additionally, deletion of the nkuA homolog has been reported to increase sensitivity toward gamma irradiation in other fungal species ( Meyer et al. 2007 ). Although we cannot discriminate the specific ISS condition that induced asperthecin production in LO1362, we hypothesize that it served as an alternative protective mechanism from the high levels of radiation present on the ISS. Our observation stays in agreement with other reports suggesting that pigment production is a key adaptive response of fungi exposed to similar environments ( Volz and Dublin 1973 ; Singaravelan et al. 2008 ; Dadachova and Casadevall 2008 ). It is therefore possible that asperthecin can be used to protect other forms of life present on the spacecraft. Cultivating plants for food in space will be crucial for the success of future space missions. However, space radiation can generate mutations in plant DNA, including base substitutions, deletions, and chromosomal alterations, which can result in genetic changes in seeds or tissue damage ( Micco et al. 2011 ; Arena et al. 2014 ). The transformation of asperthecin biosynthesis genes into plants may potentially minimize plant DNA damage, and optimize plant and astronaut health. Future studies should be conducted both on ground and on the ISS to verify this hypothesis. Interestingly, space conditions did not increase asperthecin production in LO8158, which also possesses the nkuA- genetic background. Global regulation of SM production was altered to increase SM production in both LO8158 and CW12001, but the genetic alteration was reversed through a stop lost point mutation only in CW12001. It is therefore possible that alternative metabolomic protective mechanisms were sufficient in LO8158, and therefore asperthecin production was not enhanced in ISS conditions. Only a small proportion of proteins were differentially expressed in ISS-grown A. nidulans samples, which emphasizes the potential and safety of A. nidulans as a therapeutic production host during outer space missions. This finding may not hold true across the Aspergillus genus, as increased virulence has been reported in Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from the ISS ( Knox et al. 2016 ). Currently, if pharmaceutical stocks in space are depleted, a small, unmanned spacecraft is launched to restock crew supplies. In the era of long-term space travel, the duration of future space missions is expected to drastically increase. The inability to deliver required drugs to astronauts in a timely manner could result in serious complications. Through heterologous expression of specific genes, A. nidulans introduces the ability to biosynthesize a wide range of pharmaceutical drugs within a week, which could significantly improve astronauts’ safety during long-term manned space missions. In summary, this work has revealed the multi-omic response of the well-characterized model filamentous fungus , A. nidulans , to spacecraft conditions. These findings illustrate the potential of asperthecin to confer radiation resistance and of A. nidulans to be utilized as a small molecule production host in space. Further, specific genetic mutations involved in the adaptive mechanism of fungi in space environments were identified. Such knowledge may be valuable to NASA’s Space Biology Program ( https://www.nasa.gov/spacebio ) in planning for future outer space explorations.",
