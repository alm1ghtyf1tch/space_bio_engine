    "Abstract": "Abstract Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.

    "Results": "3.1. Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs Cells were expanded for three passages before characterization using flow cytometry and combinations of mesenchymal-cell surface markers. We found that 94.9 ± 3.3% of cells were positive for CD105, CD90, and CD73, and that 99.5 ± 0.3% were negative for CD45. Then, the total number of cells, their viability, and SSEA-3-positivity of viable cells were assessed in normal hASCs (control) and in five kinds of stress-treated hASCs. One day after stress exposure, even though all stressed groups showed significant reductions (62.4–74.2%) in viable cells compared to the control group, stressed cells exhibited higher proportions of SSEA-3(+) cells (heat, 2.1%; low pH, 3.1%; proteolysis, 4.2%; hypotonia, 2.2%; mechanostress, 1.4%) compared to controls (1.3%) ( Figure 1 A). No significant differences were detected in the overall numbers of SSEA-3(+) cells between stress-treated hASCs and normal hASCs, with the exception of the mechanostress group, which showed a significantly lower number of SSEA-3(+) cells ( p < 0.01) ( Figure 1 B,C).

Cell Growth in Microgravity Microsphere Cultures Adherent cells are continuously affected by the downward force of gravity throughout the culture period, but cells attached to continuously stirred microspheres are affected by multidirectional gravitational forces (i.e., microgravity) ( Figure 2 A). The numbers of hASCs were decreased in both polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures on day 1, suggesting that some cells did not successfully adhere to the microbeads ( Figure 2 B). However, the growth rates (i.e., hASC number on day 7/day 1) used to estimate true cell proliferation showed no significant differences between groups (polystyrene microsphere, 6.0; collagen microsphere, 6.0; polystyrene dish, 5.7; collagen dish, 5.8). On day 14, there were no significant differences in the numbers of hASCs retrieved from each culture, possibly because the monolayer cultures reached confluency. Visualizations of hASCs that were adhered to polystyrene and collagen microspheres at culture-day 7 revealed their successful proliferation ( Figure 2 C). Figure 2.

Proliferation of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs in Microgravity/Microsphere Cultures As described above, the numbers of viable hASCs on day 7 were lower in the microsphere-cultured groups, regardless of the material (polystyrene or collagen) or the condition (dynamic or static), compared to the dish-cultured groups ( Figure 3 A). However, when compared to polystyrene monolayer cultures (as controls), the static-condition polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures produced 2.3-fold and 2.2-fold proportional increases, and 1.2-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the numbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs, respectively ( p < 0.05 for both). In addition, the dynamic-culture conditions produced 4.4-fold and 4.3-fold proportional increases, and 2.7-fold and 2.9-fold increases in the numbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to the dish cultures, respectively ( p < 0.001 for both) ( Figure 3 B,C). These results indicate positive effects for both the microsphere and microgravity conditions on SSEA-3(+) cell proliferation and on SSEA-3(+) cell growth rates (i.e., growth rate = SSEA-3(+) cell number on day 7/day 0) Table 2 .

Immunocytochemistry All of the pluripotent stem-cell markers examined were expressed in hASCs cultured in microgravity/microsphere cultures ( Figure 4 ). The images represent those fields where the most significant differences between the dish groups and the microsphere groups were detected. Notably, hASCs cultured on polystyrene microcarriers showed strong OCT4 and SOX2 staining, while hASCs cultured on collagen microcarriers showed strong NANOG and SSEA-3 staining. By comparison, the hASCs cultured in both polystyrene and collagen monolayer cultures stained either negative, or weakly positive, for these stemness markers. Figure 4.

Selected Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR We used RT-PCR to compare the expression of several genes involved with stemness and mesenchymal differentiation in hASCs from microgravity/microsphere cultures to their expressions in hASCs from dish cultures ( n = 3). The hASCs cultured with polystyrene microspheres under dynamic conditions exhibited significantly upregulated OCT4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , and CD34 expressions, while hASCs cultured with collagen microspheres under dynamic conditions showed up-regulations of SOX2 , NANOG , MYC , KLF4 , and CD34 expressions ( Figure 5 ). In contrast, hASCs from microsphere cultures under static conditions (both polystyrene and collagen) displayed no statistically significant differences for all the genes examined. Figure 5.

Colony-Forming Assay After 10 days of culture with an initial seeding of 1 × 10 2 cells per well, we counted cell colonies as an estimate of proliferative ability. We found a significantly higher number of colonies in the polystyrene microsphere group ( p = 0.027) and in the collagen microsphere group ( p = 0.025) compared to the polystyrene dish group ( n = 6) ( Figure 6 ).

In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay The network-formation assay showed that hASCs cultured with polystyrene and collagen microspheres formed complex, capillary-like networks more quickly and intricately than dish-cultured hASCs ( Figure 7 A). Accordingly, the lengths of cytoplasmic extensions were also significantly longer in the polystyrene- and collagen-microsphere groups compared to the dish group ( p < 0.001), whereas the microsphere material (polystyrene or collagen) had no significant effect ( Figure 7 B).

Multilineage Differentiation Assay Based on lineage-specific differentiations, hASCs that were cultured on polystyrene and collagen microspheres displayed higher levels of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation compared to hASCs cultured in polystyrene dishes (controls) using intracellular lipid content (adipogenic) and calcium deposition (osteogenic) assessments ( Figure 8 ). However, while hASCs cultured on collagen microspheres did display higher levels of chondrogenic differentiation compared to controls, those cultured on polystyrene microspheres showed similar chondrogenic differentiation compared to controls using an assessment of cartilage–micromass diameters.

    "Conclusion": "Through novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have been shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer potentially greater translational benefits. SSEA-3(+) Muse cells, a representative type of highly functional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared to regular stem cells [ 32 ]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow hASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with higher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs to only approximately 1% [ 19 ]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental stress greatly influences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency of stem cells [ 33 , 34 ]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant influence on cultured cells. Numerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell proliferation [ 35 ] and differentiation [ 36 , 37 ]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cultured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [ 38 ]. Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated, unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity vector to an average of 10 −3 × g over time [ 24 ]. In our experimental system, although cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the microspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells’ gravity vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their final cumulative gravity vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been developed [ 39 , 40 ], but they involve significant costs and are very difficult to standardize. Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-proliferative capacity [ 25 ] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [ 41 ]. In previous studies, micro-scale carriers fabricated from a variety of natural and synthetic polymers have shown significant potential for cell growth, specific differentiation, and the delivery of hASCs [ 42 , 43 ]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation has been carried out on the feasibility of culturing cells using stirred microspheres for the stated purpose of mimicking a microgravity environment. The outcomes of this study exceeded our expectations. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures under static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to polystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited a much higher number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed a positive influence of microspheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-3(+) cells, especially in those experiments combined with a microgravity environment. By comparison, our stress-exposure treatments were not very suitable for the expansion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. Heneidi et al. reported that Muse cells could be isolated from lipoaspirates using severe cellular stress, such as long-term exposure to collagenase [ 44 ]. We also confirmed that exposure to proteolysis produced the best results among our stress conditions, increasing the proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs by 3.3-fold (4.2%) compared to monolayer cultures (1.3%). During preliminary studies (unpublished data) to enhance the ratio of SSEA-3(+) hASCs (known to be stress-tolerant [ 19 , 32 ]), stress magnitude was carefully optimized in each experiment. However, because 37.6% of viable cells were lost, the final number of proteolytic solution-treated SSEA-3(+) hASCs was only 1.3-fold more (1.7 × 10 3 ) compared to the controls (1.3 × 10 3 ), with no statistically significant difference. These results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-3(+) hASCs through the selective depletion of SSEA-3(−) cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell proliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity conditions increased SSEA-3(+) hASCs by proliferation ( Figure 9 ). In other words, the present microgravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number, of SSEA-3(+) cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic cells. However, a limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA-3 as a pluripotent marker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other pluripotent markers (e.g., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between microgravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the two cultures. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Schematic representation of the study. Human adipose-derived stem cells are normally capable of heterogeneous potency. Exposure to stress can selectively deplete regular stem cells, but does not increase the number of highly functional stem cells. In contrast, microgravity/microsphere cultures can selectively cause the proliferation of highly functional cell subpopulations to reach the numbers required for regenerative therapies. Furthermore, hASCs harvested from microgravity–microsphere cultures had higher expression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4 , SOX2 , NANOG , MYC , KLF , and CD34 compared to hASCs cultured in monolayers. OCT4 and NANOG are known to be involved in the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells, while SOX2 , MYC , and KLF expression act as transcription factors to control genes involved during embryonic development [ 19 ]. CD34 has been reported to contribute to the proliferative ability of hASCs both by us [ 23 , 45 ] and by others [ 46 , 47 ]. However, the upregulation of nuclear stem-cell markers was hardly detected in hASCs from static microsphere cultures, suggesting that the microgravity environment may play a key role in preserving hASC functionality. In a previous report, spaceflight experiments demonstrated that altered gene expression was associated with epigenetic changes, such as chromatin re-modeling and DNA methylation [ 48 ]. The present results extend these observations by demonstrating improved proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation into mesenchymal lineages (adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes) in hASCs from microgravity–microsphere cultures compared to hASCs from cultures under normal conditions. However, the fold change of the genes analyzed by RT-PCR was not so large in this study (less than 1.5), and future studies are required for further qualification of these genes through optimization of the microgravity culture protocols. Interestingly, the efficacies for collagen and polystyrene microspheres to select for proliferation in highly functional hASCs were roughly equivalent in the present study. Polystyrene microbeads require a plasma coating prior to use to enable good cell attachment; therefore, collagen microbeads may be the superior practical choice for regenerative therapy applications. In addition, as a biodegradable biomaterial, collagen has the advantage that such beads may be clinically administered into a target organ together with hASCs; it may even augment hASC survival and functionality after transplantation by acting as a biological cell scaffold [ 1 , 42 ].",
