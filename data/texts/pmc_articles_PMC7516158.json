    "Abstract": "Nineteen strains from the order Lactobacillales were isolated from the International Space Station and commercial resupply vehicle, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated. WGS would permit the characterization of these potentially pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the extreme conditions of the space environment.",
