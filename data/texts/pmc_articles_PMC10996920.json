    "Results": "The baseline splenic repertoire To characterize the baseline Ab repertoire of C57BL6/J mice, we sequenced three pools, each containing equal amounts of RNA from the spleens of four different female mice ( Tables I , II ) ( 19 ). The relative abundance of detected CDR3s was characterized. A rank-abundance curve ( Fig. 1A ) was generated and showed similar initial abundances for all three normal mouse spleen pools. The SIs were 7.28, 7.39, and 7.68 for normal mouse pools 1, 2, and 3, respectively ( Fig. 1B ). FIGURE 1. Rank abundance and SI in the baseline Ab repertoire.

Each normal mouse pool (NM) is one replicate comprised of four pooled spleens. Effect of spaceflight on Ab repertoire diversity To determine how spaceflight affected the CDR3 distribution, we determined the rank abundance of normal C57BL6/Tac mice (referred to as Center for the Advancement of Science in Space [CASIS] mice) that were flown in space for a period of 21–22 d ( 5 ). Three individual CASIS animals were subjected to spaceflight and compared with normal controls ( Fig. 2A ) for the rank abundance of individual CDR3s. When the ground and flight animals were averaged by treatment, the resulting rank-abundance curves were nearly identical ( Fig. 2B ), with one CDR3 being the most abundant. A comparison of the SIs revealed no significant difference between ground and flight animals. However, there was a trend toward a lower SI, and thus, less diversity was evident in flight animals ( t test, p = 0.1138; Fig. 2C ). FIGURE 2. Rank abundance and SI in spaceflight animals.

Comparison of Ab repertoire diversity in a physiological model of microgravity and spaceflight The third comparison that we made included mice that were subjected to AOS (TARDIS experiment), their restraint, loaded controls ( 6 , 7 ), and the CASIS mice. When we compared the SIs of the CASIS ground control mice ( n = 3) and the TARDIS loaded controls that were treated only with saline ( n = 4) ( Fig. 3 ); there was no significant difference ( t test, p = 0.1201), but there was a trend toward lower diversity in the CASIS animals. This trend was also evident in the CASIS flight ( n = 3) versus AOS unloaded saline control ( n = 4) animals ( t test, p = 0.0859; Fig. 3 ). However, an assessment of the overall SI combining experimental (flight or AOS) and ground (or unloaded controls) in both experiments revealed that the CASIS animals ( n = 6) had an overall lower SI ( t test, p = 0.0004) than the AOS animals ( n = 32) ( Fig. 3 ).

The overall comparisons comprise all animals in the CASIS ( n = 6) and TARDIS ( n = 32) experiments. *** p < 0.001. Effect of AOS, TT immunization, and a CpG1826 adjuvant on Ab repertoire diversity in the spleen To understand the effects of AOS, TT, and CpG1826 on the Ab repertoire, we generated rank-abundance curves for CDR3s from the TARDIS ( 6 ) mice from the treatment groups by collapsing the data by main effect ( n = 16 per treatment group, AOS, TT, or CpG1826) ( Fig. 4A ). No significant differences were found between treated and untreated animals ( t test, p > 0.05) in any of the comparisons, although trends for higher abundance in rank one CDR3s were detected for TT-treated mice ( p = 0.0571). A comparison of SIs also showed no significant differences between treated and untreated animals (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; Fig. 4B ). Unloading did not affect the diversity of the TT− or TT + CpG1826–treated animals (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; Fig. 4C ). FIGURE 4. Rank abundance and SI in the spleen of TARDIS animals.

( C ) Average + SEM SI of the effect of AOS on TT and TT + CpG1826 animals ( n = 4 per group) Effect of AOS, TT immunization, and a CpG1826 adjuvant on Ab repertoire diversity in the bone marrow Rank-abundance curves were generated for CDR3s identified in the bone marrow ( 7 ) of the same mice used for spleen cell determinations in the TARDIS experiment described above ( Fig. 5A ). Collapsing data by main effect (AOS, TT, and CpG1826 treatment) ( n = 12 per treatment group) yielded no significant differences between treated and untreated animals for any of the groups ( t test, p > 0.05). Animals treated with TT had significantly lower (three-way ANOVA, p = 0.0137; Fig. 5B ) SIs and thus lower diversity, but AOS and CpG1826 treatments did not affect the SI (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). A three-way interaction for AOS × TT × ANOVA, CpG1826 was also detected (three-way p = 0.0442; data not shown), but unloading did not affect the diversity of the TT− or TT + CpG1826–treated animals (three-way ANOVA, p > 0.05; Fig. 5C ).

Comparison of spleen and bone marrow Ab repertoires in the same animal Spleen and bone marrow were sequenced in 18 animals in the TARDIS study, allowing direct comparisons of population diversity between the spleen and bone marrow. A rank-abundance curve of representative animals in each of the treatment groups is presented ( Fig. 6A ). The bone marrow was significantly less diverse ( Fig. 6B ) than the spleens of the same animals (paired t test, p < 0.0001). FIGURE 6.

Comparison of hypervaccinated animals to primary only animals To isolate the anti-TT–specific response, magnetic beads coated in TT were used to isolate TT-binding cells from the spleen and bone marrow from two animals ( Fig. 7A ). The abundance of the rank one CDR3 in pool 2 was over 11 times higher than pool 1 and over 6.5 times higher than pool 3. No differences in SIs were found between the hypervaccinated data and the unloaded TARDIS spleen ( t test, p = 0.4346) and the TARDIS bone marrow ( t test, p = 0.2000) ( Fig. 7B ). FIGURE 7.

PCA of CDR3 counts across studies We were fortunate to be able to examine the CDR3 repertoire in large numbers of animals subjected to various treatment protocols. We probed our data to identify principal components driving the impact on CDR3 present in the TARDIS mouse spleen ( Fig. 8A ), TARDIS bone marrow ( Fig. 8B ), and CASIS ( Fig. 8C ) animals. We also assessed all experiments used in this article ( Fig. 8D ). However, no clustering or significant principal components emerged from the PCA analyses. FIGURE 8.

Similarity of V/J pairing for a single CDR3 amino acid sequence When we assessed CDR3s present in the repertoires of all animals included in our experiments, we noted that a single CDR3 (CARGAYW) was found in every animal spleen dataset (CASIS and TARDIS). It was selected for V/J combinations analysis. The CARGAYW CDR3 sequence was also identified in 15 of the 24 bone marrow samples. One V/J combination, V1–80/J3, was involved in an overwhelming percentage, 77.4%, of V/J combinations detected ( Fig. 9A ). V1–80/J2 was responsible for 14.6% of the combinations detected, and V1–80/J4 resulted in 6.1% of the combinations found. All other detected V/J combinations (38 unique combinations) were found in <0.5% of the Ab sequences that we detected. FIGURE 9. V/J pairing in a single CDR amino acid sequence.

We also looked at a longer CDR3, CARDSNWYFDVW, which was the second most common CDR3 that was detected in every spleen animal. It was also detected in 4 of the 24 bone marrow samples. This CDR3 was highly predominated by the V9–3/J1 combination comprising 99.9% of the combinations detected ( Fig. 9B ). V3–5/J1, V1–22/J1, and V9–1/J1 were each detected once for 0.04% of combinations.",
    "Conclusion": "Our results demonstrated that subtle alterations in Ab repertoire diversity occur in response to experimental and environmental challenges. Statistical methods commonly used in the ecology field have been used by other groups to assess Ab repertoires, although often with a larger scale view ( 24 , 25 ). Some have been able to determine immunological status by examining diversity ( 26 ). Estimated hypothetical total diversity is estimated to be ~1 × 10 140 total unique CDR3 sequences ( 18 ). However, the functional diversity is much more highly restricted to around 1 × 10 13 to ~1 × 10 18 because of the V-, D-, and J-gene segments that create the CDR3 backbone ( 12 , 27 ) and because mice only have ~1 × 10 8 B cells, many of the potential CDR3s are never seen in the repertoire ( 15 ). Saada et al. ( 28 ) estimated that whereas 35 × 10 6 large pre–B cells enter mitosis each day, only around 3 × 10 6 B cells survive selection. Our study examines a total of 1,173,166 unique Ab sequences arising from 44 individual and 18 pooled animals across four experiments. In our unamplified individual mouse spleen samplings, there is an average of ~3000 unique CDR3s that are not found in any other mouse. This might translate to ~30,000 unique CDR3s if we assume we are assessing 10% of the repertoire or 300,000 unique CDR3s if that amplification is only 1% of the repertoire compared with what we might see if we amplified the sequencing. Given that mice have 1 × 10 8 total B cells, unique B cells account for ~0.3–0.03% of the repertoire, based on CDR3 capture. Our results contrast other estimations ( 12 ) of shared naive B cells at 11–13%. Therefore, our data suggest that there is more sharing of repertoires than previously estimated. We have established a baseline SI for the spleen between 7.28 and 7.68. However, it is essential to remember that these numbers were generated from pooled samples in an effort to normalize the reading. Our previous work showed that the pooled normal mouse V-gene segment usage was similar between pools ( R 2 = 0.5842–0.8427), but CDR3 sequences showed an overlap of only 75 CDR3s found in all three groups ( 19 ). We also detected a pattern in the rank-abundance curves for each pool. One predominant CDR3 comprised the highest rank, and abundance quickly dropped as rank increased, demonstrating that the population was highly skewed. The highest CDR3 in each pool was unique with CARGAYW, CASVYDG-YAFAYW, and CASYDFDYW for pools 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We also explored the effects of spaceflight alone on diversity in the Ab repertoire. Although T cell repertoires have been examined during spaceflight ( 29 ), little research exists examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire. We found no statistical difference between SIs for ground and flight animals, but a trend ( p = 0.1138) toward lower diversity in the flight animals was detected. The animals used in this experiment were older (35 wk at flight), and a different strain (C57BL/6Tac) than used in the other experiments that were analyzed in this paper. Additionally, the flight was relatively short, with only 3 wk in microgravity. Age is known to affect the Ab repertoire by reducing diversity ( 30 , 31 ) and other works have shown that aged humans respond poorly to vaccinations ( 32 ). Aging decreases B and T cell regeneration rates ( 33 ). Because the half-life of a B cell in the spleen is between 4 and 7 wk ( 34 ), a longer flight time may strengthen the lower diversity trend we noticed. The sample size was also small because these data were obtained as a secondary science objective from an initial validation flight ( 21 ) and a larger sample size may provide more information regarding this trend. The CASIS and TARDIS spleen datasets provided us a unique situation to directly compare spaceflight data to the AOS model of microgravity using the same bioinformatics methodology. Although the sequencing and bioinformatics methodology was the same, the mouse strain (C57BL/6Tac, CASIS flight; C57BL/6J, TARDIS model), age (35 wk, flight; 9 wk, model), tissue preservation (RNAlater, flight; snap frozen, model), and RNA extraction (RNeasy, flight; TRIzol, model) were all different. These differences mean that a direct comparison is less than ideal, but given the relative scarcity of data from flight animals, the comparison is nonetheless valuable. We found that the control animals (CASIS ground and TARDIS loaded) and experimental animals (CASIS flight and TARDIS unloaded) were not statistically different. However, when the complete CASIS dataset was compared with the complete TARDIS dataset, we found that the CASIS animals had significantly lower SIs. Although our total read counts were similar between the two experiments (CASIS, 66,909–181,703; TARDIS average, 82,655–109,107) ( 5 , 6 ), the low number of samples in the CASIS dataset ( n = 6) compared with the TARDIS dataset ( n = 32) is more likely to be skewed by a single low diversity mouse. Additionally, the increased age of the CASIS mice and may also contribute to their overall lower SIs, as mentioned above. In our TARDIS dataset, we explored the effects of AOS, TT, and CpG1826 treatment on the spleen and bone marrow. In the spleen we found no differences in SIs among treatment groups. This included no impact on diversity in TT− or TT + CpG1826-treated mice. However, there was a trend for a higher abundance of the rank one splenic CDR3 in TT-treated animals ( p = 0.0571). In the bone marrow, only TT-treated animals showed a reduced diversity SIs. Unloading again did not affect TT− or TT + CpG1826–treated animals. Both the higher abundance rank one CDR3s and the lower diversity are indicative of the TT-specific response. As the repertoire narrows to focus on responding to the Ag, the total number of unique CDR3s is likely to decrease, decreasing overall diversity. Greiff et al. ( 12 ) have also demonstrated that the Ag-specific response is higher in plasma cells in the bone marrow than the spleen. We were also able to compare CDR3 usage in the spleen directly to the bone marrow of the same animals in our TARDIS dataset. We found that the bone marrow had lower diversity than the spleen for all animals. This could be because the populations of cells in the bone marrow are less diverse because they are memory populations waiting to respond to agonists ( 35 , 36 ). Splenic and circulating B cells may be more diverse because they are less experienced. Alternatively, previous studies have shown that V-gene segment usage by naive B cells in the spleen and pre–B cells in the bone marrow are strongly influenced by the genetic background of the animal, whereas the plasma cells are a mostly individual variation ( 12 ). Our workflow does not allow us to identify the cells that make up our population. However, this individual variation may not explain the consistent lower SIs in the bone marrow samples of all 18 of the mice examined. To assess the anti-TT–specific response, we used TT-coated magnetic beads to isolate TT-binding cells from the spleen and bone marrow of hypervaccinated mice. One pool of mice, pool 2, showed an extreme response with the result that almost 17% of the repertoire is composed of one CDR3, CASYSNFDYW. Interestingly, this CDR3 is predominately composed of an IgM response, rather than the anticipated IgG response (data not shown). Although these data are from the pooling of two animals, the high repertoire percentage likely arose in a single animal. However, we found no difference in the TT-specific repertoire SIs as compared with the TARDIS TT + CpG1826 spleen or bone marrow. It has been previously established by multiple works ( 37 – 41 ) that the anti-TT response is very broad and highly specific, which may contribute to our overall detected diversity even when focusing on the Ag-specific response. It is also not unprecedented for memory IgM responses to occur ( 42 ). Given our large number of datasets and experiments, we attempted to isolate patterns in CDR3 usage by treatment, experiment, tissue, or other variables. The PCA revealed no patterns either within or across experiments. This lack of pattern is likely due to the highly individualized nature of CDR3 generation ( 11 – 14 ). We have previously reported that when comparing CDR3s across the eight treatment groups in the TARDIS spleen data, over 90% of CDR3s were found in only one treatment group ( n = 4). Even very-high-frequency CDR3 are at low frequency in other animals or treatment groups and, in some cases, not detected at all ( 6 , 7 ). We also explored diversity in V-gene segment and J-gene segment usage in two high-frequency public clones. The first public clone explored was CARGAYW. This CDR3 was found in CASIS and TARDIS spleen animals and 15 of the 24 TARDIS bone marrow samples. Although CARGAYW occurred at very high counts (3598) in some animals, it occurred at much lower counts ( 6 ) in others. This is consistent with previous data published by Greif et al. ( 18 ) showing that public clones have variable frequencies. One specific V/J combination, V1–80/J2, was the predominant combination, with over 77% of the CDR3s formed from these two gene segments. V1–80/J2 (14.6%) and V1–80/J4 (6.1%) also contributed to the pairings. All other combinations ( 38 ) were found in <0.5% of the sequences. Interestingly, our previous work has shown that V1–80 is one of the most commonly used V-gene segments in the mouse repertoire ( 19 ). In comparison, when we examined a longer CDR3, CARDSNWYFDVW, one combination (V9–3/J1) comprised 99.9% of combinations detected. The identification of the three other combinations (V3–5/J1, V1–22/J1, and V9–1/J1) may be the result of sequencing errors. Given the longer CDR3, it is less likely that multiple combinations could result in the same amino acid sequence. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that changes in Ab repertoire diversity are detectable using next-generation sequencing data exploring CDR3 usage. We have demonstrated that trends or significant reduction in diversity occur in response to hindlimb suspension and TT vaccination in the bone marrow. A reduced diversity is also found in the bone marrow as compared with the spleen. However, comparisons of the anti-TT repertoire to the overall repertoire of the spleen and bone marrow revealed no differences in SIs. We also were not able to detect CDR3 signatures by experiment, treatment, or tissue. We examined the V/J combinations for two common public CDR3s and found more variation in V/J pairing in the shorter CDR3 when compared with the longer CDR3. Finally, from this large multidata, we observe that there is significant individual-to-individual CDR3 uniqueness. These data suggest that an animal’s Ab repertoire is quite unique, even in a highly inbred animal. Evolutionarily, this makes sense and maximizes the possibility that the unique repertoire will allow survival against the widest array of pathogens. This is not a new concept, but these data help to support that hypothesis. Additional sequences will be needed to solidify the hypotheses generated from our analyses.",
