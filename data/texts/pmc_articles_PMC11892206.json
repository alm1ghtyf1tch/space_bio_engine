    "Results": "The mouse cardiac transcriptome after immunization on the ISS The transcriptomic changes induced in the heart following vaccination with tetanus toxoid plus the adjuvant CpG versus flight saline were identified using RNAseq ( n = 3 per group) (Fig. 1 a). The hearts of mice vaccinated in flight showed 658 upregulated and 472 downregulated transcripts ( p < 0.01) when compared to flight saline mice (Fig. 1 b). Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis on all significantly expressed transcripts indicated that inflammatory and immune responses were most highly activated (Fig. 1 c, d). A comparative overview of differential transcript expression in flight-immunized mice and flight saline mice is shown in the heat map (Fig. 1 e). The data collected from RNA sequencing was uploaded to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to assess the impact of immunization in space on major biological processes in the heart. A graphical summary of the regulation of these processes is shown in Fig. 1 f. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), interferon-gamma (IFNγ), interferon alpha 2 (IFNα2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were predicted to be activated (orange). These signaling transcripts promote immune responses and enhance pathway activation. Similarly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified an upregulation of the overall inflammatory response (Fig. 1 g). Fig. 1. Open in a new tab The Impact of Tetanus Toxoid + CpG Immunization on the Heart in Space. ( a ) Two groups of mice were sent to the ISS for 34–35 days. One group was vaccinated with tetanus toxoid plus CpG 13 days before launch, and again after 21 days in space. A second group, vaccinated with saline only, served as a control (created with BioRender.com). Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per group. ( b ) The volcano plot identified significant differences in the flight-immunized mice in reference to the flight control. The red clusters show a positive change, and the blue clusters show a negative change in transcript expression compared to spaceflight controls. ( c ) GO Enrichment analysis of statistically significant transcripts ( p < 0.05) shows the enriched processes in flight-immunized mice versus flight saline mice. ( d ) KEGG analysis revealed that the statistically significant transcripts promoted an immune response and inflammation in the heart. ( e ) The heatmap lists the top 80 up- and down-regulated genes in the flight-immunized mice when compared to the flight-saline mice. Many highly regulated genes in flight-immunized mice (left three panels) were focused on immune-associated markers when compared to flight control mice (right three panels), where, in the heat map, red shows upregulation and blue downregulation in Fragments Per Kilobase Million. ( f ) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of all statistically significant, differentially expressed transcripts predicted increased cytokine signaling as well as recruitment and response of immune cells (orange = predicted activation, blue = predicted downregulation). ( g ) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) shows that the inflammatory response was upregulated in the flight-immunized mice when compared to flight saline ( FDR q-value = 0.0 ) Toll-like receptor-mediated activation of cardiomyocytes Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or pattern recognition receptors, were analyzed for increased expression following vaccination. The adjuvant used in this study, CpG ODN 1826, is recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) [ 31 ]. However, vaccination with TT + CpG in space showed a trend toward elevated expression of several other TLRs in cardiovascular tissue. In flight-immunized mice, there was a significant increase in expression of Toll-like receptors 7, 8, and 13 when compared to the flight control group. (Fig. 2 a, b). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified enrichment of Toll-like receptors 1–9 and 11–13 (Fig. 2 c). Furthermore, there was a significant upregulation of receptors for interleukins 1, 2, 6, 11, and 18 (2 < fold change (fc) < 6,000, p-value < 0.05 , Fig. 2 d). Fig. 2. Open in a new tab Genes Encoding Toll-Like Receptors are Induced in the Heart after Immunization in Space. a , b ) Transcriptomic analysis showed induction of genes for Toll-like receptors 7, 8, and 13 following immunization in spaceflight when compared to flight control. c ) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment of genes associated with Toll-like receptor pathways. The enriched genes were depicted in red, while the genes that were not enriched were shown in blue. In this representation, the relative intensity of the color indicates the strength of gene enrichment (e.g., saturated red versus light red) or decreased gene enrichment (e.g., saturated blue versus light blue) d ) Receptors for interleukins 1, 2, 6, 11 and 18 were upregulated in flight-immunized mice when compared against flight control mice. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per group When CpG activates TLR9, it promotes a cascade of signaling molecules within cardiomyocytes that leads to the translocation of transcription factors IRF7 and NF-κB to the nucleus. Once they enter the cells, they will begin transcription of IFNα and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. This proposed mechanism of inflammation in cardiomyocytes is outlined in Fig. 3 a. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab Toll-Like Receptor-Mediated Inflammatory Response in Cardiomyocytes. a ) NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines is induced in cardiomyocytes following CpG activation of endogenous Toll-like receptor 9. Downstream effects promote an inflammatory response in cardiac tissue (created with BioRender.com). b , c ) TLR9 expression was significantly upregulated following vaccination of CpG alone in flight, on the ground, and post-TT + CpG administration in flight mice only ( n = 3–5, 2 < fc < 22, t-test, p-value < 0.05 ). d , e ) NF-κB induction occurred via CpG-only administration on the ground but required combined administration of TT plus CpG in space ( n = 3–5, fc > 1.5, t-test, p-value < 0.05 ). The flight and ground TT + CpG groups and the flight and ground CpG-only group were each normalized to their appropriate control groups On Earth, CpG alone can evoke an immune response through activation of TLR9 and, subsequently, NF-κB (Fig. 3 b, d). In spaceflight mice, RT-qPCR was used to show that there was a significant elevation in TLR9 expression following vaccination with CpG alone. However, administration of CpG alone in space was not sufficient to lead to the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3 c, e). In flight, activation of NF-κB only occurred when administration of the adjuvant CpG was combined with tetanus toxoid. Inflammatory response induced in the heart after immunization in spaceflight To further our understanding of the effects of immunization in space, we used transcriptomic analysis in combination with RT-qPCR to conduct a targeted analysis. IPA predicted that immunization in flight promoted activation of NF-κB in cardiomyocytes, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, eventually, inflammation of the myocardium (Fig. 4 a, Table S4 - S5 ). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis also identified upregulated transcripts that activate the NF-κB signaling pathway (Table S6 ). Transcription factor NF-κB is involved in inflammatory pathways where increased expression activates and maintains the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), a key modulator of chronic inflammation (Fig. 4 b). Among the immune-related pathways most activated by vaccination in flight mice, interleukin 6 was one of the most significantly changed. Given the changes in gene expression related to the regulation of IL-6 (Fig. 4 c), we focused on transcripts identified by GO enrichment analysis as related to the regulation of inflammatory pathways. Signaling from its receptor, IL6rα (Fig. 2 d), promotes the transition of infiltration from neutrophilic to mononuclear, furthering inflammation from acute to chronic [ 32 , 33 ]. Fig. 4. Open in a new tab Inflammation Occurs in Mouse Hearts Immunized in Space. ( a ) According to IPA, transcripts that lead to inflammation of the myocardium were predicted to be upregulated in immunized flight mice when compared to saline controls (orange = predicted activation). ( b ) NF-κB is a known regulator of signaling molecules which activate processes such as inflammation (created with BioRender.com). ( c ) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified positive regulation of Interleukin 6 production following immunization with TT + CpG in space. d - f ) Markers of inflammation, including NF-κB, IL-17A, and IL22ra2, were evaluated via RT-qPCR and were shown to be activated in the mouse heart post-vaccination (1.5 ≤ fc ≤ 4 in flight-immunized mice, p-value < 0.05 ). g ) STAT3 was significantly upregulated in all immunized mice when compared to controls (fc > 1, p-value < 0.05 ). h ) IFNγ, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, was elevated in flight and ground-immunized mice (fc ≥ 2, p-value < 0.05 ). Flight-immunized and ground-immunized groups were each normalized against their own flight or ground control. i ) Macrophages in the heart of flight-immunized mice were predicted to be activated according to IPA, where upregulation is identified by an orange color and downregulated transcripts are identified in blue (created with BioRender.com). Flight-immunized versus flight-control mice were compared by uploading transcripts which were altered in expression at p-value < 0.05 In order to verify that inflammation was upregulated in spaceflight after immunization, likely through an NF-κB-dependent pathway, RT-qPCR analysis was conducted on both flight groups of mice, control and immunized, as well as comparable ground controls. Vaccination led to a significant increase in NF-κB expression in flight-immunized mice, which was not observed in ground-immunized mice (Fig. 4 d). Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 22 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL-22rα2) were similarly induced in the flight-immunized mice, but not in ground-immunized mice (Figure e, f). Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) were elevated in flight and ground-immunized mice (Fig. 4 g, h). Cytokines interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were analyzed by RT-qPCR but were not induced in mice which were immunized in space (Figure S1 ). Transcripts encoding a subset of cytokines specific to the NF-κB inflammatory pathway were elevated in mice following immunization while housed on the ISS. Although we did not identify specific cell populations in our bulk transcriptomic analysis, macrophage activation was predicted in the immunized flight mice when compared to their saline-treated counterparts (Fig. 4 i). IPA predicted that a pro-inflammatory response of macrophages occurs via IL-6 activation, and polarization of M1 macrophages occurs through interleukin 12 (IL-12) activation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis identified positive regulation of IL-12 production after TT + CpG vaccination in flight-immunized mice (Figure S1 ). Immunization in spaceflight amplifies cytoskeletal rearrangements Transcripts related to cytoskeletal rearrangement were significantly induced following immunization in space. Elevated transcripts with fold changes above 4,000 are listed in Fig. 5 a, along with their functional role. These transcripts enhance signal transduction and motility between cells and mediate tubulin protein and actin-based cytoskeletal filaments. The cytoskeletal-associated transcription factor signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPA) promoted cardiac protection through the regulation of Toll-like receptor 4 and NF-κB. Elevated transcripts in flight-immunized mice as compared to flight-control mice are shown in Fig. 5 b and c, in which each distinct color denotes a different mouse in each flight group. The individual data points indicate the differential transcript expression of each of the cytoskeletal-related markers. According to the IPA and GSEA analysis, transcripts related to cytoskeletal rearrangement were elevated following IFNγ activation (Tables S7 , S8 ). This activation promotes leukocyte activation, mononuclear leukocyte migration, cell transmigration, and inflammatory responses (Fig. 5 d). Fig. 5.

Transcriptomic analysis was conducted with n = 3 biological replicates per group Transcripts protecting the heart from oxidative stress are induced in spaceflight Transcripts that aid in protecting the heart from the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were elevated after immunization in space (Fig. 6 a, b). Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (Trpm2) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1) respond to inflammation by maintaining homeostasis and were upregulated in flight mice after immunization. Many of the protective transcripts induced in this model exhibited a fold change exceeding 1,000 in the flight-immunized mice ( p < 0.01) (Fig. 6 a). RT-qPCR was used to further validate the transcriptomic data. We analyzed hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which protects various organ systems, including the heart, against the effects of oxidative stress [ 34 – 36 ]. HGF transcript levels were significantly increased in all immunized mice (Fig. 6 c). Notably, glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3), superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2), or prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), mediators of oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species stabilization, were not induced in flight-immunized mice (Fig. 6 d-f).

( a ) Oxidative stress transcripts were significantly elevated in flight mice after immunization when normalized to flight control mice, according to transcriptomic analysis. ( b ) The function of several upregulated transcripts related to oxidative stress included protection from cell damage through increased response to stress and ROS. Many of these markers lead to cell and mitochondrial protection. ( c ) RT-qPCR analysis showed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a cardioprotective gene active during heart damage, was highly elevated in all immunized mice when normalized to their appropriate controls (fc ≥ 4, p-value < 0.05 ). d - f ) RT-qPCR was used to verify that no significant change in common oxidative stress markers was detected in immunized mice when compared to flight control and ground immunized mice ( p-value < 0.05 )",
    "Conclusion": "In this study, we identified transcriptomic changes that occur in the mouse heart following immunization with TT + CpG in the spaceflight environment. A shift in cytokine expression and activation of the NF-κB pathway, leading to inflammation, occurred following vaccine administration. Although reports of myocarditis associated with vaccination on Earth are rare [ 37 , 38 ], immunization with an adjuvant under microgravity conditions aboard the ISS can activate transcripts associated with inflammation in the heart. Tetanus toxoid vaccinations have been implemented as part of health regimes worldwide, commonly as part of the TDAP vaccination series [ 39 ]. The tetanus toxoid vaccine contains an inactivated form of the tetanus toxin. This version is recognized by the body, priming immune cells for future encounters. Tetanus is a potentially life-threatening disease commonly found on metal surfaces. Vaccinations have been developed to prevent the bacterial neurotoxin that causes the disease. The tetanus vaccine is first administered at two months of age and is followed by boosters every ten years through adulthood [ 39 ]. Our study utilized the tetanus toxin vaccination model since it has the potential to be relevant for astronauts on long-duration space missions. Accordingly, vaccinations and boosters for other diseases should be studied in the future for prolonged missions. It has recently been reported that thirteen strains of E. bugandensis , a drug-resistant bacterium, were isolated from the ISS [ 40 ]. Under stress, mutations in these strains occurred such that they evolved to become distinct compared to their Earth counterparts [ 40 ]. Astronauts may require immunization while in space due to these or other potential bacteria, including Clostridium tetani , the bacteria that causes tetanus [ 41 ]. Understanding how space changes the response to pathogens is important, especially because vaccination in flight elicits a dampened immune response when compared to vaccination on Earth [ 42 , 43 ]. Changes in the physical environment can disrupt cell function and cell signaling. Immune cells readily respond to cytokine signaling. Microgravity produces a shift in the expression of cytokines and their receptors [ 44 – 46 ]. In space, receptors that activate T cells, such as Toll-like and interleukin receptors, demonstrate reduced signaling. If the receptors present on immune cells are disrupted, downstream activation and proliferation of the cell will be inhibited [ 47 ]. In space, reports have shown that spleen and thymus mass decrease post-flight [ 48 , 49 ]. Furthermore, microgravity impedes proper adhesion of mononuclear cells. Suppression of surface adhesion molecules, such as CD62L and HLA-DR, prevents cell-to-cell signaling, tissue migration, and antigen presentation, dampening the overall immune response [ 50 ]. One proposed method of improving immune responses during spaceflight is the inclusion of adjuvants, such as CpG, during immunization. On Earth, CpG, an immune-stimulating molecule, acts as an agonist for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which promotes the activation of B cells, leading to a more robust immune reaction [ 51 – 53 ]. TLR9 stimulation can activate IRF7 signaling, which regulates T cells through IFNα release [ 54 ]. This effect appears to occur in our model following immunization with CpG alone. Alternatively, TLR9 activation can induce NF-κB which leads to inflammation [ 55 ]. The response triggered by the interaction between TLR9 and NF-κB on Earth has been reported to induce inflammation in multiple organ systems, including the lungs [ 56 ]. TLR9 is also known to be expressed by cardiomyocytes [ 57 ]. Once a cardiomyocyte responds to TLR9 signaling, pro-inflammatory cytokines are released, and a domino effect activates inflammation in neighboring cardiomyocytes via stimulation of the NF-κB pathway [ 58 , 59 ]. The subsequent cytokine release activates resident macrophages [ 60 ]. The cardiomyocyte-specific inflammatory response leads to cardiac remodeling [ 61 ]. Our findings suggest that activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, in addition to those associated with TLR9, can occur when tetanus toxoid + CpG is administered in the spaceflight environment. TLR7, 8 and 13 transcripts were significantly elevated in our model. Although TLR13 has no analog in humans, TLR7 and TLR8 are present in humans and can be identified on antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as on cardiomyocytes [ 62 – 66 ]. TLR7 recognizes pathogens and initiates an immune response by promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and consequently, TLR7 antagonists inhibit cardiomyocyte inflammation [ 67 ]. TLR signaling leads to myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1) activation. MyD88 activation, utilized by all TLRs except TLR3, induces NF-κB, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines [ 68 ]. In cardiomyocytes, expression of TLR8 and its interaction with MyD88 can initiate and maintain a chronic immune response in the heart [ 64 ]. Macrophages may also play a role in cardiac inflammation through cytokine release and infiltration into cardiovascular tissue. Activated resident or infiltrating cardiac macrophages can undergo cytoskeletal remodeling, as identified in flight-immunized mice, which may be attributed to tubulin re-organization [ 69 ]. Plectin (Plec) transcripts were upregulated almost 15,000-fold in flight-immunized mice. Plec proteins are involved in the organization and stabilization of the cytoskeleton and the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation [ 70 ]. When activated, macrophages become plectin-positive [ 71 , 72 ]. Similarly, allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1), another marker of inflammation which is primarily expressed by macrophages, alters the cytoskeleton and was elevated in our model [ 73 ]. AIF1 interacts with TLR2 and TLR4, which were enriched in our study. These TLRs are important mediators of inflammatory pathways [ 74 ]. AIF1 also plays a role in the activation of the transcription factor the NF-κB which can induce a potent inflammatory response [ 75 ]. Prolonged activation of NF-κB can lead to tissue damage [ 76 ]. Inflammatory markers were not induced in the heart by the spaceflight environment in the absence of immunization [ 11 ], nor were they elevated in the mice which were immunized on the ground. However, inflammation associated with elevated expression of NF-κB was identified in the hearts of mice that received the TT + CpG vaccination in space. In this study, immunization can be viewed as a two-hit stressor on the heart, where one hit is represented by the vaccine itself, and the second hit by the spaceflight environment. Under these conditions, the combination of two hits in space versus one hit on Earth influences the cellular response, impacting the activation of signaling pathways and leading to inflammation. On Earth, TNF-α and IL-1β activate the canonical NF-κB-dependent inflammatory pathway [ 55 ]. In our study, these inflammatory signaling molecules were not activated in the hearts of immunized mice either on Earth or in space. In mice which were immunized in space, IL-17A and IL-22 were induced, resulting in activation of NF-κB which is capable of initiating a positive feedback loop by sustaining the release of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 77 ]. This response was not evident in the mice immunized on the ground. Additionally, prolonged activation of STAT3, for example, can lead to inflammatory disease [ 78 ]. In the heart, when STAT3 is elevated in the presence of IL-6, a positive feedback loop maintains STAT3 in the phosphorylated state for extended periods [ 79 ]. This effect is regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), whose activity may differ in the spaceflight environment [ 79 ]. Prolonged STAT3 activation leads to cardiac dysfunction [ 79 , 80 ]. The immune response may be prolonged in flight mice due to continued activation of regulators of STAT3. The spaceflight environment impacts the immune system as a consequence of both microgravity and radiation [ 42 , 81 ]. The role of NF-κB and the mechanisms by which inflammation occurs in various organs during spaceflight are currently under investigation in several laboratories [ 82 , 83 ]. Interestingly, during a typical inflammatory response on Earth, NF-κB activates pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNFα [ 55 ]. However, recent studies show that in some cases, the selective activation of cytokines, such as IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-17, during spaceflight depends on the antigen and/or adjuvant administered [ 84 ]. Furthermore, an inflammatory response can be initiated by resident and systemic cells, and the response may be tissue-specific. In the heart, inflammation can disrupt the network of microtubules and intermediate filaments in cardiomyocytes that alter the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton [ 85 , 86 ]. If inflammation becomes chronic after stress, it can direct cardiomyocytes toward ventricular remodeling [ 61 , 87 ]. This would be consistent with the idea that the prolonged stress due to spaceflight, combined with the increase in inflammation after exposure to an antigen, could lead to cardiac remodeling in astronauts. Interestingly, immunization in space induced transcripts that function to protect against oxidative stress in the presence of inflammation, including HGF, Gpx4, and TRPM2. HGF is expressed during myocardial injury and protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis via inhibition of caspase activation [ 34 , 88 ]. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), one of the most highly expressed oxidative stress-related transcripts in flight-immunized mice and a key antioxidant agent, inhibits ferroptosis through the reduction of Glutathione [ 89 , 90 ]. The expression of this gene stabilizes mitochondrial membrane potential [ 91 ]. TRPM2 is an ion channel which is activated during periods of oxidative stress and helps to maintain the balance of ions in the heart [ 92 , 93 ]. TRPM2 plays a vital role in protecting the heart from damage caused by reactive oxygen species [ 92 , 93 ]. Cytoprotective transcripts, which are elevated in the heart in space, may contribute to maintaining homeostasis in the cardiac environment. DNA replication (Figure S2 ), which was elevated in our study, may reflect an increase in cardiomyocyte nuclei number in the absence of cell division which has been reported in association with improved cell responses and survival during stress exposure [ 94 , 95 ]. Cardiac protection can aid in adaptation and may account for the absence of reported long-term adverse effects on the heart following space travel. Spaceflight studies include limitations such as the number of animals which can be housed on the ISS and the number of variables that can be tested at any one time. Consequently, our study was limited to the use of same-sex, same-strain mice. Future work using the experimental design reported here should include both male and female mice to address this question further in the spaceflight environment, with and without immunization. The use of inbred mice and a defined immunization schedule over a specified amount of time should allow for reproducibility of the current findings and an expansion of the information gained here in mice of both sexes.",
