    "Abstract": "Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J- Kit W /Kit W-v /J ( Kit W/W-v ) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in Kit W/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.

    "Results": "2.1. Immune Cell Reconstitution The time course for immune cell reconstitution is shown in Figure 2 . Representative FACS plots of mesenteric lymph node immune cells in respective treatment groups showed extensive reconstitution of B and T cell compartments with donor-derived GFP+ immune cells in recipient mice 9 weeks following adoptive transfer ( Figure 2 A). Reconstitution of recipient mouse B cells and T cells with donor HSC-derived GFP + B cells and T cells was in progress in both WT and Kit W/W-v mice by 4 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer ( Figure 2 B). By 9 weeks, excellent reconstitution with donor-derived GFP + B cells and T cells was observed in the blood ( Figure 2 C) and following necropsy in mesenteric lymph nodes ( Figure 2 D) in both WT and Kit W/W-v mice. Additionally, GFP + cells were common in bone marrow ( Figure 2 E), indicating efficient repopulation of bone marrow from donor HSCs. Notably, the magnitude of hematopoietic cell reconstitution did not differ significantly between WT and Kit W/W-v mice. As expected, the control mice had no GFP-labeled cells. Figure 2.

Body Composition and Blood Glucose Levels The effects of adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into irradiated WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice on total body and selected organ weights and on blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer are shown in Table 1 . No significant differences in terminal body, spleen, or adrenal weights were noted and there was no difference in blood glucose levels at 11 weeks post irradiation/adoptive transfer. Abdominal WAT and seminal vesicle weights were lower in BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice compared to WT mice. Table 1.

No significant differences between the WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice were observed for humerus length, total humerus bone volume, or cortical (cross-sectional volume, cortical volume, marrow volume, polar moment of inertia) and cancellous (cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular spacing) architecture.

The effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice on total lumbar vertebra bone volume and cancellous bone architecture in the vertebral body are shown in Table 3 . With the exception of trabecular thickness, which was lower in BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice compared to WT mice, no group differences were noted for endpoints measured (total vertebral bone volume, cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular spacing).

The effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice on total femur bone mass and volume, on cortical bone architecture in midshaft femur, and cancellous bone architecture in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis are shown in Table 4 . No differences were observed for femur bone area, BMC, or BMD between WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice. Femur length, total bone volume, and cortical thickness likewise did not differ between the two groups. However, compared to WT mice, BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice had lower cross-sectional, cortical, and marrow volume and lower polar moment of inertia. There were few differences in cancellous bone microarchitecture, the exceptions being that connectivity density in BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice was higher than in WT mice in distal femur metaphysis but lower in distal femur epiphysis.

Static and Dynamic Histomorphometry The effects of irradiation/adoptive transfer of WT HSCs into WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice on static and dynamic bone histomorphometry in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 5 . No differences were observed for bone area fraction, mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rates (perimeter, bone, and tissue referents), osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, or osteoblast-lined bone perimeter. Bone marrow adipocytes were common in WT mice but not detected in 8 out of 10 Kit W/W-v mice; adipocytes were present in very low numbers in the remaining 2 Kit W/W-v mice. Adipocyte area/tissue area and adipocyte density were much lower in BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice than in WT mice but the few adipocytes that were present did not differ in size from those present in WT mice. The pronounced difference in adiposity can be appreciated in representative photomicrographs from a WT and a BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mouse ( Figure 3 ). Table 5.

    "Conclusion": "Adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT HSCs was effective in reconstituting the immune systems of both WT and Kit W/W-v mice following lethal irradiation. In agreement with prior studies [ 31 , 33 ], adoptive transfer of WT HSCs did not result in accrual of BMAT in the femurs of Kit W/W-v mice. Furthermore, the near absence of BMAT did not prevent equalization of most bone parameters, particularly for cancellous bone, between WT and Kit W/W-v mice. Kit W/W-v mice have a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain that inactivates the kit receptor in one allele and a mutation in the other allele that prevents translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the cell surface [ 34 ]. Consequently, activation of the kit receptor by a kit ligand is greatly reduced but sufficient to allow for survival. The kit ligand is produced in two forms, as membrane-bound and as soluble. The Sl mutation in Kit Sl/Sld mice deletes the entire Sl (kit ligand) gene whereas the Steel-Dickie ( Sl d ) mutation, resulting from an intragenic 4-kb deletion, removes sequences encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, limiting expression of the gene to produce only a soluble form of kit ligand [ 35 ]. Male Kit W/W-v mice, comparable in age (and housing conditions) to mice evaluated in the present study, had lower total body weight, WAT weight, and seminal vesicle weight and lower serum glucose levels compared to WT mice [ 31 ]. Kit W/W-v mice also had a lower cancellous bone volume fraction and higher bone turnover in the distal femur metaphysis [ 31 ]. Other studies described osteopenia associated with abnormalities in bone turnover balance in female Kit W/W-v mice [ 30 ] and male and female Kit Sl/Sld mice [ 32 ]. The differences between Kit signaling-deficient Kit W/W-v and Kit Sl/Sld mice and WT controls reported in the literature contrast with the minimal differences at cancellous bone sites reported in this study following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs to normalize kit signaling. These findings suggest an important role for kit signaling in bone metabolism. However, they do not identify the underlying mechanisms or target cells. We have administered soluble kit ligand to Kit Sl/Sld mice and have successfully adoptively transferred purified WT HSCs to male and female Kit W/W-v mice [ 29 , 31 , 33 ]. Neither approach resulted in the accrual of BMAT. However, a detailed comparison of the immune system and skeletal response of WT and Kit W/W-v mice to the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs had not been performed. In the present study, we confirmed that rescue of kit signaling in Kit W/W-v mice following adoptive transfer of WT HSCs does not result in the accrual of BMAT in the femur. On the other hand, normalization of kit signaling equalized many of the divergent bone parameters typically observed between WT and Kit W/W-v mice. This latter finding argues in favor of defective HSC differentiation as the primary cause for the skeletal abnormalities in kit signaling-deficient mice. However, the findings do not rule out a role for BMAT in supporting hematopoiesis. There is strong in vitro evidence that adipocytes support the long-term survival of hematopoietic lineage cells via kit signaling [ 36 ] and a recent study concluded that lipolysis from BMAT is required to fuel bone cells and the marrow niche following energy deficits or injury [ 21 ]. However, weight loss due to a chronic energy deficit has highly variable effects on BMAT levels in humans as well as experimental animals [ 37 , 38 ]. Decreased weight due to involuntary caloric restriction often, but not always, leads to an increase in BMAT [ 37 , 39 ]. In contrast, weight loss resulting from increased hypothalamic leptin levels results in no change or decreased BMAT [ 40 , 41 ]. Additionally, the effects of injury induced by exposure to ionizing radiation on bone marrow adiposity are highly variable, ranging from no change to large increases [ 33 , 42 ]. This variability in response to irradiation may be due to radiation dose, skeletal site evaluated, or timing of measurement. The latter is likely important because high doses of ionizing radiation result in a rapid decrease in bone marrow cell density followed by gradual recovery [ 42 ]. Specifically, following a whole-body dose of 137 Cs (6 Gy), bone marrow cell density declined by 77% after 1 day and 86% after 3 days. However, by 2 weeks post irradiation, recovery was well underway. Importantly, the effect of radiation on cells was not uniform; while total marrow cell numbers declined drastically post irradiation, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter increased [ 42 ]. Furthermore, neither bone marrow collapse nor early-stage recovery (2 weeks) was accompanied by increased BMAT. In contrast, we observed increased BMAT following a longer duration (8 week) recovery post lethal irradiation [ 33 ]. Taken together, these findings suggest BMAT levels are a marker of recovery and argue against the hypothesis that energy stored in BMAT is critical to support bone marrow recovery following radiation-induced injury. The present study directly tested the requirement for BMAT for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal (10 Gy) irradiation. Exposure to high-dose whole body radiation results in a large negative energy balance as well as massive cell death [ 42 , 43 ]. Despite the absence of BMAT, the reconstitution of lymphocyte cell populations in the present study with only 1000 donor GFP-expressing cells was similar in WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice. Kit W/W-v mice are mast cell-deficient, and we detected mast cells on bone surfaces in these mice following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs, further supporting the successful restoration of normal hematopoietic cell differentiation. It is important to note that mesenchymal stem cells are radioresistant and, consequently, bone marrow cells expressing kit ligand are available to support hematopoiesis following irradiation. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that BMAT is not required for skeletal recovery from injury and energy deficit following exposure to high-dose radiation. It is well established that kit is expressed by HSCs and kit ligand by differentiated mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and adipocytes [ 32 ]. However, recent studies suggest that there are kit-expressing populations of mesenchymal cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes [ 44 , 45 ]. We previously demonstrated that the purified HSC population used for adoptive transfer can differentiate in vitro into osteoclasts but not osteoblasts or adipocytes [ 33 ]. We also demonstrated that inhibition of kit signaling with the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gleevec rapidly reduced marrow adipocyte area and density in rats, suggesting that maintenance of mature adipocytes in bone marrow requires kit signaling [ 29 ]. Further research is necessary to determine whether the adoptive transfer of kit-expressing WT mesenchymal cells restores the ability of Kit W/W-v mice to accrue BMAT. This study has limitations. The present study was performed in male mice. However, we have previously shown that female Kit W/W-v mice are also BMAT-deficient prior to and following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs [ 33 ]. Lymphocytes can influence bone metabolism [ 46 , 47 ] and mast cells have been implicated in diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice [ 48 ]. Additionally, mast cells participate in several skeletal disorders, including parathyroid bone disease [ 49 ]. Further research will be required to tease out the contribution of specific immune cells to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice. Although we did not include unirradiated WT and Kit W/W-v mice in the current analysis, the skeletal phenotypes of male and female Kit W/W-v mice and Kit S/Sld mice have been reported [ 30 , 31 ]. In summary, adoptive transfer of WT HSCs attenuated the skeletal differences between WT and BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice, with the notable exception that mature adipocytes continued to be absent or very rare in the bone marrow of femurs of Kit W/W-v mice. The absence of BMAT had little or no influence on the reconstitution of immune, osteoblast, or osteoclast cell populations following lethal radiation. Taken together, these findings indicate that BMAT is not required for recovery from severe bone marrow injury. Our findings also support the conclusion that kit signaling plays an important role in bone turnover balance in mice. Finally, the present studies demonstrate the value of BMAT-deficient Kit W/W-v mice as a model for investigating the role of BMAT in bone physiology.",
