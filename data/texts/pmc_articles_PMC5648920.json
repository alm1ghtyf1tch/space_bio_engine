    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is altered during space flight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant differences ( P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space flight. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a major concern of mission planners for human space flight, that bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might develop a higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space flight environment. The results of this study do not support that notion. KEYWORDS: antibiotic profiling, Bacillus subtilis , International Space Station, phenotype, space flight",
    "Results": "PM screening for differential antibiotic resistance in FL versus GC samples. Using Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) plates PM-11C, PM-12B, and PM-13B ( Table 1 ), triplicate B. subtilis flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples were screened for their resistance to 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors. Each compound was tested at four different concentrations, and FL samples were compared to GC samples. For the majority of compounds tested (63 of 72), no significant difference was detected in FL versus GC samples by PM screening, and statistically significant differences were detected for 9 of the 72 compounds tested ( Table 1 ). These nine inhibitors were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of FL samples which showed significantly increased resistance compared to GC samples, and the second group consisted of FL samples which showed significantly decreased resistance compared to GC samples.

Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of the areas under the curves (AUCs). *, P ≤ 0.05 by Student's t test ( n = 3). Enoxacin. Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone family that is no longer used clinically in the United States. It acts primarily by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV ( 15 ). The resistance to enoxacin was observed to be >50-fold higher in FL (area under the curve [AUC] of 2,508 ± 627) than in GC (AUC of 44 ± 58) samples ( Table 2 ). Examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to enoxacin showed that FL cultures were significantly more resistant than GC cultures at the highest enoxacin concentration tested, in well E08 ( Fig. 1A ). 6-Mercaptopurine. The DNA synthesis inhibitor 6-mercaptopurine is primarily used as an anticancer and immunosuppressive drug and is not currently used clinically to treat bacterial infections. However, recent studies have indicated that it can inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium spp. ( 16 , 17 ). The resistance to 6-mercaptopurine was observed to be ∼2-fold higher in FL (AUC of 3,722 ± 894) than in GC (AUC of 1,835 ± 11) samples ( Table 2 ). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to 6-mercaptopurine revealed that FL cultures were significantly more resistant than GC cultures in the second well tested, C02 ( Fig. 1B ). Trifluoperazine. Trifluoperazine is an efflux pump inhibitor originally identified as an antipsychotic and anxiolytic drug but has since been shown to exhibit broad-spectrum in vitro antimicrobial activity ( 18 , 19 ). The resistance to trifluoperazine was observed to be ∼1.8-fold higher in FL (AUC of 3,659 ± 749) than in GC (AUC of 2,018 ± 628) samples ( Table 2 ). Examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to trifluoperazine showed that FL cultures were significantly more resistant than GC cultures at the second concentration tested, in well G10 ( Fig. 1C ). Compounds with higher resistance in GC samples. GC samples were observed to be significantly more resistant than FL samples to 6 growth inhibitors [lomefloxacin, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, manganese(II) chloride, and cesium chloride] ( Table 2 ; Fig. 2 ). FIG 2. Open in a new tab Resistance profiles of FL (white bars) and GC (gray bars) samples to lomefloxacin (A), nalidixic acid (B), penimepicycline (C), rolitetracycline (D), CsCl (E), and Mg(II)Cl 2 (F). Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of the areas under the curves (AUCs). *, P ≤ 0.05 by Student's t test ( n = 3); n.d., not detected. Lomefloxacin and nalidixic acid. Lomefloxacin and nalidixic acid are both fluoroquinolone antibiotics belonging to the same family as enoxacin ( 20 ) and which also inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV ( 21 , 22 ). The resistance to lomefloxacin was observed to be ∼1.4-fold lower in FL (AUC of 3,222 ± 776) than in GC (AUC of 4,509 ± 135) samples, and the resistance to nalidixic acid was also observed to be ∼1.4-fold lower in FL (AUC of 2,496 ± 200) than in GC (AUC of 3,437 ± 105) samples ( Table 2 ). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to lomefloxacin showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the highest concentration of lomefloxacin tested, in well B12 ( Fig. 2A ) and at the third concentration of nalidixic acid tested, in well E11 ( Fig. 2B ). Note that at the highest concentration of nalidixic acid tested (well E12), FL samples appeared to be more resistant than GC samples. However, we were unable to compare FL versus GC samples statistically, because no metabolic activity was detected in the GC samples ( Fig. 2B ). Penimepicycline. Penimepicycline is a combination of mepicycline, a derivative of tetracycline which inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit ( 23 ), and phenoxymethylpenicillin, a derivative of the cell wall inhibitor penicillin ( 24 ); this antibiotic is no longer commercially available. The resistance to penimepicycline was observed to be slightly (∼1.2-fold) but significantly lower in FL (AUC of 3,738 ± 269) than in GC (AUC of 4,400 ± 160) samples ( Table 2 ). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to penimepicycline showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the second concentration tested, in well B06 ( Fig. 2C ). Rolitetracycline. Rolitetracycline is also a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline ( 23 ). The resistance to rolitetracycline was observed to be slightly (∼1.1-fold) but significantly lower in FL (AUC of 4,556 ± 53) than in GC (AUC of 4,998 ± 167) samples ( Table 2 ). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to rolitetracycline showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the first concentration tested, in well D09 ( Fig. 2D ). Cesium chloride. Cesium chloride (CsCl) is known to be toxic to many microorganisms, but its cellular target(s) and mechanism(s) of action are poorly understood ( 25 ). The resistance to CsCl was observed to be significantly lower (∼1.13-fold and ∼1.27-fold) in FL than in GC samples at the two highest concentrations tested, exhibiting AUCs of 3,219 ± 68 and 2,467 ± 91 (FL) versus AUCs of 3,462 ± 112 and 3,139 ± 100 (GC), respectively ( Table 2 ). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to CsCl showed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures at the third and fourth concentrations tested, in wells F03 and F04 ( Fig. 2E ). Mn(II)Cl 2 . Growth inhibition by manganese results from its competitive replacement of a magnesium cofactor in essential enzymes ( 26 ). Resistance to Mn(II)Cl 2 was observed to be slightly lower (∼1.06-fold) in FL (AUC of 5,391 ± 120) than in GC (AUC of 5,713 ± 133) samples ( Table 2 ). An examination of the dose response of FL versus GC samples to Mn(II)Cl 2 revealed that FL cultures were significantly more sensitive than GC cultures in the third well tested, G07 ( Fig. 2F ). Additional DNA gyrase inhibitors. We noted above that of the 9 compounds exhibiting differing resistance levels by PM screening in FL versus GC samples, three (enoxacin, lomefloxacin, and nalidixic acid) belonged to the quinolone/fluoroquinolone family of DNA gyrase inhibitors, suggesting that DNA supercoiling may be affected by space flight. The gyrase inhibitors ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin were also included in our initial Omnilog PM screening, but were not identified as exhibiting significant differences in FL versus GC samples ( Table 1 ). When the PM data were examined more closely ( Fig. 3 ), we observed that ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin were not present in PM plates at concentration ranges useful for determining resistance or sensitivity to these antibiotics. In the cases of ofloxacin and oxolinic acid, both FL and GC samples grew equally well at all four concentrations tested ( Fig. 3A and B ). On the other hand, the growth of FL and GC samples was essentially inhibited completely at all 4 concentrations of novobiocin tested ( Fig. 3C ). Thus, no conclusions about the relative resistance of FL versus GC samples to these three antibiotics could be drawn from the PM screening experiment. Consequently, we chose to test the resistance of FL versus GC samples to ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin using the broth dilution method as described in the following section. FIG 3. Open in a new tab Resistance profiles of FL (white bars) and GC (gray bars) samples to ofloxacin (A), oxolinic acid (B), and novobiocin (C). Data are shown as means ± standard deviations of the areas under the curves (AUCs). Data were not significantly different (Student's t test, P > 0.05, n = 3). n.d., not detected. IC 50 s of FL versus GC samples by broth dilution. While PM microplates were very convenient and useful for high-throughput screening of the resistance profiles of FL and GC samples to many antibiotics, they also presented a number of limitations. First, the actual concentrations of the antibiotics present in the PM screening plates are proprietary information. Second, in some instances, the antibiotic concentrations in PM plates were not within a useful range ( Fig. 3 ). Third, not all representatives of each antibiotic class are included on PM plates. For these reasons, we chose to more closely quantify antibiotic resistance levels (50% inhibitory concentrations [IC 50 s]) of FL and GC samples to a selection of antibiotics using the broth dilution method as described in Materials and Methods. We determined the IC 50 s of FL and GC samples to antibiotics identified as significantly different in PM plates (6-mercaptopurine, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, nalidixic acid, and trifluoperazine). We also tested quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotics that were included in PM plates but were outside a useful concentration range (ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, and novobiocin). In addition, due to their common clinical use and their inclusion in the ISS pharmacy ( 27 ), we also decided to determine the IC 50 s for the fluoroquinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, which were not included in the PM panels used. Each of the 10 antibiotics were screened over a range of concentrations allowing normal growth to complete sensitivity, and IC 50 s were determined for each sample using normalized A, μ, and AUC. The broth dilution data are presented graphically for ciprofloxacin as an example of how the IC 50 s were determined for each antibiotic ( Fig. 4 ), and the complete data set of IC 50 s for all 10 antibiotics is presented in Table 3 . Examination of the data revealed no statistically significant differences between the IC 50 s for FL versus GC samples regardless of the parameter used (A, μ, or AUC) for any of the 10 antibiotics tested ( Table 3 ). FIG 4. Open in a new tab Typical data from broth dilution assays used to compute the IC 50 s presented in Table 3 . Data for ciprofloxacin is presented as an example. Maximum absorbance (A; left), maximum growth rate (μ; center), and area under the curve (AUC; right) are presented for flight (FL; open circles) and ground control (GC; open triangles) samples. Data are averages ± standard deviations ( n = 3). Solid circles and triangles denote the computed IC 50 s for FL and GC samples derived from the growth data. These points are offset slightly from the dashed line at 0.5 for clarity. TABLE 3.

    "Conclusion": "Understanding the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human space flight environment is relevant to long-term human missions to distant exploration targets such as asteroids or Mars ( 11 ). In particular, the possibility that space flight increases the resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics and other biocidal compounds has long been of concern to mission planners. In the experiments reported here we measured the antibiotic resistance profiles of B. subtilis cells, grown in the space flight environment onboard the International Space Station and in matched ground control conditions, to a battery of 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors using Omnilog PM microplates. In PM microplates, no significant difference in the resistance levels between FL versus GC samples was observed for 63 out of the 72 compounds tested ( Table 1 ). Only 9 of 72 antibiotics tested in PM plates demonstrated statistically significant differences in the resistance levels of FL versus GC samples ( Table 2 ). However, the magnitude of differences in FL versus GC resistance to 8 of the 9 antibiotics, while statistically significant, was very modest (2-fold or less) ( Table 2 ). Furthermore, FL samples were more resistant than GC samples to only 3 of the 9 antibiotics, but were more sensitive than GC samples to 6 of the 9 antibiotics tested ( Table 2 ). In PM microarrays, FL samples were dramatically more resistant than GC samples to only one of the 72 antibiotics tested, enoxacin (>50-fold; Table 2 ). This result will be discussed further below. Taken together, the PM data do not support the generally held contention that growth of microbes under space flight conditions leads to increased antibiotic resistance. We next used standard broth dilution assays to determine the IC 50 s for 10 clinically relevant antibiotics that warranted closer examination. No statistically significant differences in IC 50 s were observed between the FL and GC samples for any of the antibiotics tested, regardless of the growth parameter examined (maximum growth achieved [A], maximum growth rate [μ], or AUC) ( Table 3 ). For most of the antibiotics tested, these results were not surprising, given the very slight (2-fold or less) effects seen in the PM microplate assays ( Table 2 ). In the case of only one antibiotic, enoxacin, were the PM and broth dilution results clearly at odds. This discrepancy may be due to the different variables tested in the two assays. In PM microplates, metabolic activity is measured photometrically using a redox dye, whereas in the broth dilution assay, cell growth is measured by turbidity, i.e., by optical density. Regardless, the results of the two assays do not support the notion that space flight increases the antibiotic resistance of microorganisms. We feel obliged to discuss alternative factors that might affect the above conclusion. First, the choice of growth media, culture conditions, test organisms, and space flight hardware can account for differing responses to the space flight environment (reviewed in reference 3 ). Second, the experimental design we used might deemphasize differences between FL and GC samples. Despite the different environments in which FL and GC samples were grown, the actual antibiotic resistance assays were performed under Earth-bound laboratory conditions. It is possible that during the 24-hour duration of the assays, FL samples might have readapted physiologically to 1× g , thus minimizing differences with the GC samples. While it is difficult to control for this factor, we note a previous space flight experiment in which Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were grown in FL and GC, and FL samples were shown to be more virulent in BALB/c mice on Earth after space flight ( 28 ). The results presented here indicate that space flight causes only minimal alterations in the phenotypic response of B. subtilis cells to antibiotic susceptibility, with the possible exception of enoxacin. The probability that any differences seen could have resulted from a genetic change, such as a mutation, is very low. In a separate experiment using the same biological research in canisters (BRIC)-21 FL and GC samples as those tested here, we measured the frequencies of mutations to antibiotic resistance in all of the FL and GC petri dish fixation units (PDFUs) used in this study (data to be published elsewhere). In all 12 samples, the mutation frequencies were less than 10 −7 (i.e., less than 1 mutant per 10 million cells). This frequency is much too low to produce an effect on the antibiotic resistance of the bulk population. To gain a more accurate understanding of the response of microbial cells to antibiotics in space, it would be ideal to design experiments for the high-throughput screening of antibiotics directly in the space flight environment. A preliminary step has already been taken in this direction. For example, the resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast to the antifungal agent voriconazole was shown to differ in FL versus GC samples using the free-flying PharmaSat nanosatellite ( 8 ); such a design could readily be adapted for high-throughput in-flight antibiotic screening either by a free-flying nanosatellite or by a small semiautonomous payload sent to the ISS. Taken at face value, it would seem that the results of this study imply that there is little cause for alarm regarding the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microbes during human space flight. However, it should be emphasized that these in vitro experiments exploring antibiotic resistance only touch upon one small facet of the chemotherapy of a potentially infected astronaut. Many aspects of the interplay among the host, the microbe, and the antibiotic (such as modes of entry, routes of pathogenesis, pharmacokinetics, etc.), which have been studied extensively in Earth-bound clinical settings, have yet to be explored in the space flight environment. As a final note, aside from their clinical significance, antibiotics have long been used to probe basic biological processes at the molecular level (such as replication, transcription, translation, membrane and cell wall biogenesis, etc.). From this perspective, it is interesting to note that among the 9 antibiotics flagged by PM screening as showing different sensitivities in FL versus GC samples, 3 belonged to the quinolone/fluoroquinolone class of compounds (lomefloxacin, enoxacin, and nalidixic acid). These compounds inhibit DNA gyrases, which are type II DNA topoisomerases that function to (i) condense DNA in the cell, (ii) maintain DNA under the optimal supercoiled state for gene expression, and (iii) decatenate DNA during chromosome partitioning ( 29 ); all three functions of DNA gyrases are essential for cell viability, and moreover, are sensitive to environmental changes. From the above observations, it is attractive to speculate that the growth of cells in the space flight environment may lead to alterations in DNA supercoiling, hence, in global gene expression ( 30 ). This notion could be tested directly by measuring the superhelicity of DNA in FL versus GC cells of B. subtilis in a manner similar to that previously described ( 31 ).",
