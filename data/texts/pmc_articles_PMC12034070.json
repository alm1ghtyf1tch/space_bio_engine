    "Abstract": "Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and injury prevention to improve muscle strength and size, particularly in load-compromised individuals. BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and hypertrophy at lower ...",
    "Results": "This pursuit of type II muscle fiber activation is a primary rationale for the production of mechanical tension in resistance training. Conventionally, the pathway to improving hypertrophy is by using loads >60% of the 1-repetition max (1RM) with 8 to 12 repetitions per set, or strength 80% to 100% of 1RM with 1 to 5 repetitions per set. 16 However, muscle hypertrophy and activation of type II muscle fibers have been shown to be equally achieved across a variety of loading parameters, such as 30% to 80% of 1RM with a consistent theme of training to volitional fatigue. 11 , 16 , 17 , 18 Athletes who are load compromised secondary to structural or functional constraints may not tolerate heavy loads well and may need to use an alternative mode of exercise to elicit metabolic stress, muscle damage, and mechanical tension to stimulate the appropriate skeletal muscle response to resistance exercise and induce anabolism. BFRT is a modality that is capable of achieving these results in load-compromised individuals.",
    "Conclusion": "BFRT has applications across the continuum of human performance, from immobilization, early rehabilitation with low loads, low-intensity aerobic exercises, as part of a comprehensive strength and conditioning plan, and in recovery. The use of conventional strength training is strongly supported along with the inclusion of BFRT as an adjunct in the otherwise healthy population to optimize mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress to drive muscle growth. It is our role as performance coaches and rehabilitation providers to restore, refine, and prepare the relevant structural and functional qualities of the individual for the task in which they will be participating. Muscular hypertrophy is a foundational performance precursor to be able to express and withstand the biomotor, sensorimotor, and bioenergetic demands of sport. BFRT is a progressive training stimulus that can be incorporated across a variety of populations, in number of applications, to produce a more resilient individual.",
