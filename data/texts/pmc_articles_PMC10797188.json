    "Results": "Spaceflight compromises y w but not hop Tum-l emergence Lb and Lh females attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host’s body cavity. Depending on the host’s ability to defend itself and the wasp’s ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host’s puparium ( Figure 1 A). To study the effects of spaceflight on this host-parasite scuffle, naive hosts or Lb17 -/ Lh14 -infected hosts were held in ventilated fly boxes (VFBs); these fly boxes were then placed into a cargo transfer bag (CTB) aboard the ISS or at the ground facility tracking ISS conditions ( Figures 1 B and 1C). The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures (fly strains y w and y w , hop Tum-l ) and four fly/parasite co-cultures on each host strain ( Figure 1 D). Survival of animals was scored post-flight (see STAR Methods ). Figure 1.

Female wasps have shorter antennae than males (right). (B) Vented fly box (VFB) with 15 holding slots for fly vials. (C) Six VFBs in one cargo transfer bag (CTB). Samples in the CTB were placed in the ISS by the crew. The ISS flight conditions were mirrored at the Kennedy Space Center laboratory, where ground control samples were housed for the duration of the mission. (D) The FFL-03 experimental design consisted of two fly-only cultures and four fly/wasp co-cultures, as shown. See STAR methods for more details. We found that the overall yield of both male and female y w flies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground-reared flies ( Figures 2 A–2C; FFL-03 ground control and space samples retrieved post-flight are referred to as G0 and S0, respectively). The trend was somewhat different for the hop Tum-l animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected ( Figures 2 A–2C). Thus, under the FFL-03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors. There was no significant difference in the yields of flies and wasps from the fly/wasp co-culture vials ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Figure 2.

Effects of spaceflight on gene expression in adult flies To understand the molecular basis of the effects of spaceflight on flies, we analyzed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) gene expression results in naive adult flies. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)| > 1. The close clustering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal-component analysis (PCA) show that the experiment was well controlled ( Figure S1 A). Overall, the y w strain was more sensitive to spaceflight than hop Tum-l , with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs (spaceflight versus ground control samples), respectively ( Table S1 ), a difference that is also reflected in the PCA plot ( Figure S1 A). A separate RNA-Seq analysis of white-eyed ( w 1118 ) flies, also on the SpaceX-14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male fly heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,991 33 ). Although the sample types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that the y w strain is more sensitive to space conditions than the y w hop Tum-l and the w 1118 strains. On Earth, the hop Tum-l strain showed 9.69% DEGs relative to y w , with more than two-thirds of DEGs upregulated and the remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal ( Table S1 ). Volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison ( Figures S1 B–S1E). This distinction between the strains is also clearly evident from Gene Ontology-based Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showing active Toll/Imd (immune deficiency) signaling not only in naive G0 hop Tum-l compared to y w flies but, surprisingly, also in S0 y w and hop Tum-l flies, relative to their G0 counterparts ( Figure S2 A). Furthermore, for these same three comparisons, the top 20 significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05) Gene Ontology terms in Biological Process enrichment analyses included host defense terms such as response to bacterium, response to other organism, and response to biotic stimulus ( Figure S2 B). These four comparisons allowed us to decouple the effects of genetic strain differences in the S0/G0 culture conditions. We next examined changes in expression patterns of the most significantly DEGs (Top DEGs), genes essential to fly viability (Essential DEGs), and immune genes in the JAK/STAT and Toll/Imd pathways (Pathway DEGs), as summarized in Figure S1 F. Top DEGs in space include members of protease, endopeptidase, and matrisome gene families We analyzed 172 annotated Top DEGs (see STAR methods for selection of Top DEGs) and identified six profiles described here in two broad categories ( Figures 3 A–3F). In the first category ( Figures 3 A and 3B), we consider the Top DEGs showing differential expression in the two fly strains as follows. (a) Top DEGs upregulated in G0 hop Tum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hop Tum-l versus S0 y w ) include genes annotated for stress- and immune-related peptides (Tot and Tep family members), proteases, and endopeptidases ( Figure 3 A). (b) The Top DEGs downregulated in G0 hop Tum-l versus G0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space (S0 hop Tum-l versus S0 y w ) include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone H4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes ( Figure 3 B). Exceptions to both of these trends were also observed ( Figures 3 A and 3B). These results define strong differences in DEG patterns in hop Tum-l and y w flies. They also show that the molecular gene expression differences between two genetic strains, for many but not all genes, are maintained in spaceflight conditions. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Differential expression of Top DEGs in S0/G0 adult flies (A and B) Top DEGs upregulated (A) or downregulated (B) in G0 hop Tum-l vs. G0 y w . Most genes in panel A that maintain differential expression in space are Toll pathway target genes 34 , 35 ( TotM and Tep1 family members, SPH93 , and CG18563 ). Lectin-24A is predicted to bind galactose, and its human homolog is associated with the 3MC syndrome 3. 36 Notable DEGs in panel (B) with disease-relevant human orthologs are CG32379 , CG32318 , and CG30059 . 37 (C and D) Comparisons showing differential expression of upregulated (C) and downregulated (D) genes in S0 y w versus G0 y w . Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in these profiles. The fly histone H1 s (orthologous to the human H1 gene, implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia 38 ) and CG6431 , a triacylglycerol hydrolase (orthologous to several human disease genes implicated in cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes), are downregulated (D). (E) Genes in hop Tum-l whose expression is activated in space. Cuticle-related and chorion-family genes are included in this profile. CG3108 is predicted to enable metallocarboxypeptidase activity, whose human orthologs are implicated in familial febrile seizures 11 and familial temporal lobe epilepsy 5. 37 (F) Genes in y w and hop Tum-l whose expression is downregulated in space. Cuticle-related and flight-related genes are included. Flight-related genes are CG34327 (associated with abnormal flight), flightin ( fln ), and Troponin C isoform 4 ( TpnC4 ). See also Figure S1 . In the second broad category, we consider the effects of spaceflight on Top DEGs in individual strains as follows ( Figures 3 C–3F). (a) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 y w , when compared to the respective ground control group (i.e., G0 y w ), encode (i) structural proteins for cuticle (e.g., chitin-binding domain-containing proteins of the Twdl, CPLCA, and Cpr families) and (ii) proteins with the GYR/YLP domain or immune response-related proteins ( Figure 3 C). (b) Top DEGs downregulated in S0 y w flies but not in S0 hop Tum-l flies, when compared to respective ground control groups, include members of the yellow gene family ( yellow-g , yellow-g2 , yellow-e3 ), bearded gene family ( Brd , Tom , BobA ), Histone H1 s, and several genes for chorion constituents and chorion assembly (e.g., Cp7Fb , Cp7Fc , Cp16 , Cp19 , Cp36 , Cp38 , Mur11Da ; Figure 3 D). These Cp genes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively amplified in the follicle cells of the ovary. 39 (c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 hop Tum-l , when compared to the respective ground control group (G0 hop Tum-l ), include Cpr family genes, Osiris family genes, tracheal-prostasin ( tpr ), a protein important for sleep regulation ( nemuri , nur ), and CG3108 ( Figure 3 E). (d) Top downregulated DEGs in S0 versus G0 flies of both genetic backgrounds include several cuticle-related (CPLCA, CPLCP) families and flight-related genes (e.g., flightin [ fln ] and Troponin C isoform 4 [ TpnC4 ]; Figure 3 F). Chitin supports the epidermal and tracheal cuticles and the peritrophic matrices that line the gut while the chorion makes up the egg shell. These comparative RNA-Seq results suggest that matrisome genes of many multigene families that encode proteins of the Drosophila cuticle 40 are sensitive to spaceflight. Essential genes are downregulated in y w flies exposed to spaceflight To further understand the differential effects of spaceflight on fly survival, we examined the expression of 1,024 essential genes that have been identified in genetic experiments as indispensable for life (see STAR methods ). Across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential genes to be differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1). Strikingly, the space environment had a profound effect on the differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds. For example, in G0 hop Tum-l versus G0 y w samples, only 15 differentially expressed essential genes were either upregulated (11 genes) or downregulated (4 genes), whereas spaceflight conditions affected the transcription of 95 genes in the S0 hop Tum-l versus S0 y w comparison (81 genes upregulated, 14 genes downregulated, Figure 4 A). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Differential expression of essential genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) The expression of 137 genes essential to fly viability that were differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in one or more comparisons is shown. (B) Expression of 34 genes pertinent to human health. The DIOPT category and score-relevant human disease or trait linked to the human ortholog were determined using the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool. 41 The disease/trait category for the fly gene refers to at least one human disease or trait linked to one or more human ortholog. MS, musculoskeletal; DN, development/neurological; MO, metabolic-/obesity-related; S, skin-related; P, pulmonary; IA, infection and/or autoimmune; C, coronary-/cardiac-related. (C) The differential expression of essential genes with no human ortholog or none-to-low disease relevance. See also Figure S1 . The most striking effects of spaceflight were seen in y w flies: 96 genes were either upregulated (24 genes) or downregulated (72 genes) in y w space-flown samples compared to the respective ground control samples. The most strongly upregulated DEGs of these 96 DEGs, with log2-(FC) > 2, include Cpr65Ec (cuticular protein), CG15784, and CG30457 (both latter genes lack annotation). The most highly downregulated genes are S1A serine protease Notopleural and histone H1 His1:CG31617 , with log2-(FC) < −1.9. Remarkably, gene expression changes were milder in space-flown hop Tum-l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8 genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples ( Figure 4 A). These results likely explain why y w flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than hop Tum-l flies. Differentially expressed essential genes reveal association with human disease conditions To assess why S0 y w flies were sensitive to spaceflight and if they have relevance to human conditions, we filtered the 137 essential DEGs for a DIOPT (Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) score of at least 12 and identified 34 high-scoring DEGs that we grouped into broad categories. Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Oseg5 and Biotinidase expression was downregulated in G0 hop Tum-l versus G0 y w flies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes, veil and melt , showed significant upregulation ( Figure 4 B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (see Figure 4 B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes in hop Tum-l versus y w flies were l(2)03659 (enables organic anion transporter activity) and Ir40a (involved in response to humidity changes), 42 both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0 y w flies and S0 hop Tum-l flies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls ( Figure 4 C). Spaceflight activates the expression of immune genes in S0 adults and increases inflammatory tumor burden in S0 hop Tum-l A comparison of the Gene Ontology-based pathway and Biological Process enrichment terms associated with the y w versus hop Tum-l transcriptional profiles provided a “big picture” view of the differential effects of space on the two strains. Both plots show that, while most GO terms and almost all biological processes are affected in y w flies, only a few parameters change in both strains. Most notable of these are the Toll/Imd pathway and lysosomal pathway terms that are significantly enriched in the space samples for both genotypes, suggesting the activation of inflammation-related genes in space ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Since the hop Tum-l mutant fly strain carries a constitutively active JAK enzyme, 43 the transcriptional activation of known JAK-STAT target genes is expected in hop Tum-l flies relative to y w flies without this mutation. Consistent with this expectation we found many target genes ( Idgf1, SOCS36E , TotA , CG3829, CG4793 , CG13559 , and CG10764 ) to be differentially upregulated in G0 hop Tum-l versus G0 y w flies. High levels of JAK-STAT pathway genes TotA , diedel , et , and CG4793 in hop Tum-l versus y w were maintained in space ( Figure 5 A). Similarly, several Toll pathway components (PGRPs SA, SB1, and SD, grass, SPE) and target genes were significantly upregulated in G0 hop Tum-l versus G0 y w flies ( Figures 5 B–5E). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed immune signaling genes in S0/G0 adult flies (A) JAK-STAT pathway components and target genes are shown based on fold induction. Genes were grouped based on their annotation in FlyBase 37 as follows: u pd2 and u pd3 are ligands; CycD , CycE , and Cdk2 are positive regulators; diedel , Socs36E , and et are negative regulators. The target genes are TotA , Idgf1 , pirk , mfa s, CG3829 , CG4793 , CG13559 , CG10764 , CG15211 , and Gf . (B–E) Differentially expressed Toll pathway components: core components (B), pathogen recognition receptors (C), antimicrobial peptides (D), and other targets (E). Only significantly affected DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1, in one or more comparisons) are shown. See also Figures S1 and S2 . Whereas many immune genes are constitutively active in hop Tum-l flies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes in y w flies ( Figures 5 B–5E). The JAK-STAT pathway ligands ( upd2 and upd3 ), several core components ( SOCS36E ), and target genes ( TotA , Gf , mfas , and CG15211 ) were activated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies ( Figure 5 A). A clear signature for Toll/Imd pathway activation was also observed in S0 y w adults. Elevated expression of pathway components ( CG8046 , Toll-9 , Figure 5 B), pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs, PGRPs SA , SB1 , SD , Figure 5 C), several antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes ( Figure 5 D), and other Toll/Imd pathway target genes ( Figure 5 E) was observed in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Notably, some Toll/Imd pathway target genes (e.g., Drsl2 , 3 , 5 ) were also activated in S0 hop Tum-l versus G0 hop Tum-l flies ( Figure 5 D). To examine if the immune gene expression changes identified in space animals might have influenced tumor development in S0 hop Tum-l adults ( Figure 6 A), we scored tumor number and size (small, medium, large tumors, T score; see STAR methods and Figures 6 B and 6C). In 25–30 adults from three independent G0 and S0 cultures, the average weighted T score was 1.07 ± 0.22 in G0 adults and 2.94 ± 0.40 in S0 flies ( Figure 6 D), although this difference is lost in the adult G1 and S1 progeny of these G0/S0 animals ( Figure 6 E). Tumors were not detected in S0 y w animals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Tumor burden in naive G0/S0 hop Tum-l fly adults (A) Experimental design for space and ground hop Tum-l flies for post-flight experiments. The progeny of 300 females and 150 adult males were raised either in the ISS or at KSC (see STAR methods ) at 22°C, and then at 25°C, once returned to the laboratory. Tumors were scored in larval and adult samples. (B and C) Representative G1 hop Tum-l adult female (B) and male (C), showing tumor size classes: small, medium, and large. (D and E) Weighted average number of tumors per animal (tumor burden) in adult fly samples retrieved from ground (G0) and space (S0) (D) and values from their ground (G1) and space (S1) adult progeny (E). The weighted tumor numbers per animal in G0 and S0 adults were 1.07 ± 0.22 and 2.94 ± 0.40, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.015, Student’s t test; ∗ indicates p < 0.05). The weighted average tumor numbers per animal in G1 and S1 hop Tum-l adult males were 5.09 ± 0.08 and 5.07 ± 0.33, respectively (mean ± standard error; p = 0.95, Student’s t test). See also Figures S1 and S2 . High immune gene expression persists in naive S1 larvae As in the mutant hop Tum-l adults, high gene expression levels of the JAK-STAT and Toll/Imd pathway genes encoding ligands, cytoplasmic mediators, and targets were recorded in naive G1 and S1 hop Tum-l larvae when compared to G1 y w and S1 y w larvae, respectively ( Figures S3 A–S3E). Thus, in hop Tum-l larvae, the immune effects of spaceflight are evaluated in the background of constitutive immune signaling. We assessed if naive S1 y w or hop Tum-l larvae showed any lingering effects of space observed in their S0 parents. Spaceflight-responsive differentially expressed immune genes in naive S1 y w larvae included CG10764 , LUBEL , PGRP-SB1, -SC1a, -SC1b , and AMP genes, CecB , AttC , Drs , and Drsl5 ( Figures S3 A–S3D). Similarly, naive S1 hop Tum-l larvae showed elevated expression of immune targets DptA , DptB , CecA2 , Drsl3 , Drsl5 , and CecA1 relative to their G1 counterparts ( Figure S3 D). Thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was elevated in S1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different. Naive S1 versus G1 hop Tum-l larvae maintained the difference in inflammatory tumor burden observed in their parents (0.08 ± 0.03 and 0.21 ± 0.06, respectively, p = 0.010; Figures 7 A and 7B), although the mitotic index in the underlying hematopoietic tissue was not significantly different (2.74 ± 0.93% of G1 and 1.95 ± 0.66% of S1 macrophages were phospho-histone H3 positive; p = 0.53). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Cellular immunity in G1 and S1 hop Tum-l larvae, post parasitization (A) Tumor (T) scores of uninfected (UI) and tumor and encapsulation (T + E) scores of G0/S0 Lb - or G0/S0 Lh -infected G1/S1 hop Tum-l larvae. Value above each bar indicates the mean ± standard error. (B) Summary of the statistical analysis of pairwise comparisons of T or T + E scores (see STAR methods ). Lb17 wasp infection rows are shaded for clarity. p values < 0.05 (Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples) were considered significant (bold). See also Figures S3–S7 . Tumor-encapsulation scores are higher in S1 than in G1 hop Tum-l hosts Previous studies with hop Tum-l larvae have shown that Lb17 attack provokes stronger cellular immune reactions than Lh14 does. While Lb17 attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes (not recruited into the melanized tumors), Lh14 -infected hop Tum-l larvae instead develop small melanized specks 8 (see Figure S4 for examples of immune reactions). To assess if naive S1 versus G1 hop Tum-l larval hosts differ in their ability to mount an encapsulation response, we exposed them to G0/S0 Lb17 or Lh14 wasps and computed a composite tumor-encapsulation (T + E) score for these animals, which measures their self- and wasp egg-induced encapsulation response. The experimental design consisted of scoring T + E scores from all G/S and host/parasite combinations. The following findings emerged from our comparisons of naive versus Lb17 - or Lh14 -infected hop Tum-l hosts. First, naive versus G0 or S0 Lb -infected G1 or S1 hop Tum-l hosts showed a ∼17- to 52-fold increase in T + E scores, and scores from three of the four combinations differed significantly ( Figures 7 A and 7B). The T + E score in naive versus G0/S0 Lh -infected G1 or S1 hop Tum-l hosts in all four combinations similarly increased from 1.4- to 14-fold, and the increases were significantly different across all four comparisons ( Figures 7 A and 7B). It is noteworthy that the canonical Toll pathway target Drs is strongly upregulated in S1 hop Tum-l hosts after Lb17 infection, but its expression remains unchanged after Lh14 infection ( Drs , Figures S3 F and S3G). This trend is characteristic of these wasps’ effects on wild-type hosts 8 and suggests that the overall differences in wasp virulence were maintained in spaceflight. Second, S1 compared to G1 hosts, infected by S0 (but not G0) wasps of both species (S0 Lb/Lh_ S1 hosts versus S0 Lb/Lh_ G1 hosts), were more competent at mounting an immune response (3.64 ± 0.46 versus 2.11 ± 0.72 [p = 0.0199] for Lb17 and 0.76 ± 0.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.04 [p = 5.55 e−10] for Lh14 ; Figures 7 A and 7B). Thus, not only is the tumor score higher in naive S1 compared to G1 hop Tum-l larvae but S1 hosts are also more immune reactive than G1 hosts. Third, on ground hosts, space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. T + E scores in G1 hop Tum-l hosts subjected to S0 or G0 parasites of the same species ( S0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts versus G0 Lb/Lh_G1 hosts) showed that, for both parasites, the T + E values for S0 wasp infections were significantly lower than the corresponding values for G0 parasites (2.11 ± 0.72 versus 4.10 ± 0.65 for Lb17 [p = 0.0199] and 0.11 ± 0.04 versus 1.13 ± 0.33 [p = 0.000915] for Lh14 ). The difference was not significant in space hosts ( Figures 7 A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions, they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently. S0 wasps largely maintain their inherent virulent strategies, although we could detect subtle differences in their abilities to affect host immunity relative to G0 wasps. Lymph gland morphologies of naive and infected G0 and S0 hosts Upon Lb17 attack, hemocytes in wild-type lymph gland lobes divide and differentiate into lamellocytes and disperse into the hemocoel to surround the wasp egg. 44 , 45 , 46 Hemocytes in the hop Tum-l lymph gland actively divide and differentiate in the absence of infection. 43 Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity ( Figures S5 A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naive y w ground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal. Like lobes from G0 naive y w animals, lobes from S0 naive y w animals did not exhibit any hemocyte loss or any other obvious morphological change ( Figures S5 A–S5H). In contrast to naive y w animals, all anterior lobes of naive G0 and S0 hop Tum-l larvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation ( Figures S5 I–S5P). The mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many GFP-positive lamellocytes were present in G0 and S0 hop Tum-l samples. Some tumors were observed as small aggregates or as free-floating structures in the hemolymph made of macrophages and lamellocytes ( Figures S5 J and S5N). No clear difference in the posterior lobes was detected due to spaceflight in either fly strain. G1 and S1 y w host lymph glands were unresponsive after Lb parasitization ( Figures S6 A–S6F). In naive G1 hop Tum-l lymph glands, GFP-expressing cells were absent ( Figures S6 G and S6H), whereas in S1 hosts lamellocytes were clearly observed regardless of infection status ( Figures S6 I–S6P). In some samples, lamellocyte-rich tumors were associated with the anterior and posterior lobes (e.g., S1 sample, Figures S6 K and S5L). In only one S1 host, the anterior lobes exhibited a strong anti-wasp response ( Figure S6 O). Thus, even though the T + E scores rise in response to Lb infection, this difference was not reflected in the lymph gland morphologies of the animals we examined. Lh14 infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. This effect is attributed to the presence of EVs in the entire lymph gland. 20 EVs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of G0 and S0 Lh -infected G1 and S1 y w hosts, and this association was accompanied by the loss of hematopoietic progenitors ( Figures S7 A–S7F). Similarly, in G1 and S1 hop Tum- l hosts, the progenitor population was reduced, and EVs were present in the lymph glands of hosts after S0 Lh infection. (G0 Lh wasps were not available for this experiment.) Lymph glands from uninfected G1 or S1 hosts do not possess EVs ( Figures S7 G–S7N). Thus, spaceflight does not affect the entry or distribution of Lh EVs in the hemolymphatic system. Perturbation of Lb and Lh EV gene expression The venom fluid containing the EVs is injected into the host during oviposition. Due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes, 17 , 20 our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the EVs. Since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes ( Figure S8 A). Overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected ( Figures S8 B and S8C), although they were modest, and less than 1.5% of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls (293 and 310 transcripts, for Lb17 and Lh14 , respectively). A majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps ( Figures 8 A–8C; Tables S2 and S3 ). Furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. Of the downregulated DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05), more than 80% showed log (2)-FC between −1.00 and −2.00 (228/280 in Lb17 and 250/261 in Lh14 ). The remaining downregulated DEGs showed log (2)-FC between −2.00 and −9.18. Only 6 of all DEGs showed a log (2)-FC > 2 for Lb17 ; this number was 16 for Lh14 . These DEGs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations. Figure 8.

Numerical identifiers correspond to EV genes in Tables 1 and 2 , with their corresponding accession numbers. (C) Number of transcripts from adult male and female wasps, showing fluctuation in space. The term “all transcripts” refers to the number of transcript sequences in the Lb17 ( GAJA00000000 ) and Lh14 ( GAJC00000000 ) transcriptomes that aligned with the corresponding RNA-Seq reads. 47 The term “all DE transcripts” refers to the number of differentially expressed transcripts in spaceflight vs. ground control samples ( Tables S2 and S3 ). A majority of transcripts were downregulated. See STAR methods and Figure S8 for more details. (D) Transcripts coding for EV proteins in the RNA-Seq samples show that 312 Lb17 EV and 398 Lh14 EV transcripts were identified for each wasp. Of these, only 29 Lb17 and 5 Lh14 transcripts were differentially expressed in S0 vs. G0 samples. Their identities, fold-change values, and conserved protein domains are shown in Tables 1 and 2 . See also Figures S8 , S10 , and S11 . The identities of the proteins constituting L. boulardi EVs were recently published. 14 Our comparative analysis indicated that Lb EV proteins show an overall profile similar to the Lh EV profile; both are enriched in mammalian EV proteins. 15 A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 for Lb17 and 398/406 for Lh14 ). In Lb17 , 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed ( Figure 8 D). Of these, 28 were downregulated ( Table 1 ). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins ( GAJA01018902.1 , log (2)-FC = −1.27, and GAJA01006288.1 , log (2)-FC = −1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP in Lb EVs is implicated in wasp virulence. 48 , 49 Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one ( GAJA01018902.1 ) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55). For Lh14 , only 5/398 (1.61%) transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5-fold upregulated ( Table 2 ). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin-binding domain. Table 1.

The master record for the Lh14 TSA sequence database is GenBank: GAJC00000000 . Spaceflight does not significantly affect wasp emergence Spaceflight did not significantly affect the overall development of wasps. The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples ( Figure 2 E). The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each Leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hop Tum-l hosts in space and also on Earth ( Figures 2 D and 2E). However, while no hop Tum-l hosts escaped parasitization by Lb or Lh in either ground or space cultures, some y w flies emerged in the co-culture vials ( Figure 2 D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial; Figure S9 A), we found no significant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp samples. Both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions ( Figure S9 B), reinforcing this conclusion. EV morphology and Lh14 virulence We next investigated whether the morphology of EV particles produced by both wasp species is affected by spaceflight. In the scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples of G0 and S0 Lb17 wasp venom, we observed no gross morphological difference ( Figures S10 A–S10G). The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously 9 , 16 were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0 Lh14 EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures 9 ), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples ( Figures S10 H–S10S). Overall, the Lh14 particle morphologies were uniform, and the particles were spiked, with variable spike length. An ex vivo assay was used to detect changes in G0 versus S0 L. heterotoma virulence. Lamellocytes from laboratory-reared hop Tum-l larvae were exposed to venom fluid from G0 or S0 wasps. Venom from both wasp types promoted changes in lamellocyte shape compared to the buffer control (6.50% ± 0.76% G0; 6.12% ± 0.71% S0; 2.99% ± 0.06% buffer control), but there was no significant difference in the S0 versus G0 Lh14 venom activity ( Figures S11 A–S11C). These results are consistent with the unremarkable difference in the overall L. heterotoma success (emergence) of S0 versus G0 Lh14 wasps. Mutant Lh14 strains Space-radiation-induced mutations in D. melanogaster have previously been reported. 51 , 52 We hypothesized that parasitoid wasps are similarly sensitive to high levels of radiation in the ISS. We therefore examined the grandsons of space-returned males ( Figure 9 A). While no heritable defects were observed for any Lb17 or ground-raised Lh14 , we obtained two recessive mutations in Lh14 ( Figures 9 B–9G). In the aurum 1 mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden (horizontal arrows; Figures 9 B, 9 C, 9 E, and 9 F; side-by-side view in panel G). This mutant is homozygous viable, and a pure-breeding stock could be established (see STAR methods ). A second phenotypic alteration was identified in this pure-breeding aurum 1 stock, where the posterior wing margin in affected individuals is angular as opposed to the wild-type round shape (vertical arrows; Figures 9 D–9F). In rare cases, this kona 1 mutation was incompletely penetrant, where only one wing was affected ( Figure 9 F). To our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps. Figure 9. Open in a new tab Mutant strains of L heterotoma (A) Steps employed for the isolation of mutant wasps. (B–F) Phenotypes of mutant wasps (C–F), identified from space samples compared to wild-type (B) Lh wasps. Males of wild type, aurum 1 (pigmentation of the wing blade and of wing veins affected), and kona 1 (wing shape affected) wasps are shown. Horizontal arrows point to differences in melanization in wild-type versus aurum 1 mutants. The color difference is subtle but consistent. Vertical arrows point to the angular wing shape of the kona 1 mutant as compared to the rounded wild-type wing blade. Double mutants in panels (E) and (F) possess both mutant traits. The shape of the left wing in panel (F) is wild-type in appearance, while the right one (arrow) is angular. Samples in panels B–F were photographed at the same time. (G) A side-by-side comparison of wild type (left) and aurum 1 (right) wings shows a clear difference in the melanization of wing veins. (H) The aurum and kona loci appear to be unlinked, as F2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions. (I) Homozygous kona 1 females are unable to oviposit based on observations of more than 30 hosts dissected. (The number of hosts scored is indicated in parentheses). (J) Representative ovipositors from wild-type and mutant wasps. Homozygous kona 1 females with defective ovipositors show areas of compromised integrity or have branched ends (arrows) compared to the continuous ovipositors with sharp ends from wild-type control wasps ( +/+ ). Posterior is to the top. Scale bar = 300 μm. See also Figure S12 . To assess if aurum and kona genes are unlinked, we scored over 1,000 sons of unmated double mutant heterozygous females. Roughly equal numbers of parental and recombinant classes were observed (chi-squared test, p = 0.63; Figure 9 H). Even though the kona 1 strain was homozygous viable, we were unable to make a pure-breeding stock. Moreover, we did not find wasp eggs in dissected hosts, regardless of whether the infecting kona 1 /kona 1 females were unmated or mated. This result suggested that homozygous kona 1 females were unable to oviposit while their heterozygous counterparts were successful ( Figure 9 I). The ovipositors of kona 1 homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle-like ends of the wild-type Lh ovipositor ( Figure 9 J). Abdominal dissection of kona 1 /kona 1 females revealed ovaries and eggs that are morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous females ( Figure S12 ). Thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected in kona 1 mutants, and they are sterile due to their inability to oviposit.",
    "Conclusion": "American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted. 4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space. 53 H. juglandis is a small ectoparasite that attacks moths. The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, on D. melanogaster and H. juglandis . 53 , 54 D. melanogaster , however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous “fruit flies in space” studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health. 4 , 55 Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits, 33 , 56 Drosophila born in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short-term exposure to microgravity and radiation. Strain-specific effects on survival and transcriptional readouts in Drosophila are induced by spaceflight stressors Spaceflight conditions exerted unexpected and differential effects on our experimental Drosophila strains. While the hop Tum-l flies with CI survived just as well in space as on the ground, the y w strain, free of tumors and CI, was surprisingly more vulnerable to the spaceflight stressors, and fewer y w flies emerged from the flight compared to ground cultures. Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following. First, specific expression profiles of Top DEGs attributed to genetic differences were maintained in space, suggesting that the gene regulatory circuits underlying these differences may be sufficiently robust and may therefore remain refractory to spaceflight. Second, the Top DEGs include genes encoding structural proteins for the cuticle and the chorion, an observation that was also reported in a previous multigenerational study on wild-type flies. 55 Some of the cuticle-related DEGs were upregulated in one of the two S0 genetic strains, but not in the other S0 strain, while other DEGs were downregulated in S0 flies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests that transcriptional co-regulation of promoters among Top DEG family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environmental variables. Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the fly’s exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they surround structurally and functionally. 57 , 58 A highly coordinated chitin synthesis and degradation program underlies insect growth. It would be interesting to assess if the cuticle or the chorion of S0 flies differs from that of G0 flies. Third, numerous essential genes were downregulated in space in y w , but not in hop Tum-l animals, suggesting that the cumulative effect of their reduced transcription may have led to their reduced viability. Thus, while increased tumor burden and alterations in gene expression in S0 hop Tum-l adults did not compromise their overall survival, y w flies exhibited increased immune gene expression, remained tumor-free in space, and exhibited reduced survival. Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes in these genetic strains. Many of these essential fly genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions. These results not only defied our expectation that animals with chronic disease would be more vulnerable to spaceflight but also suggested that, if extrapolated to other animals, spaceflight’s effects on individuals of distinct genetic backgrounds may not necessarily be straightforward to predict. Elevated immune signaling in space hosts Our previous molecular-genetic analysis of hop Tum-l larvae showed that hyperactive Toll signaling in larval lamellocytes contributes to CI phenotypes. 24 A plethora of target genes of both the JAK-STAT and Toll pathways is constitutively active in hop Tum-l mutants. Strikingly, many of the same pathway components and target genes that are constitutively active in hop Tum-l mutants are also upregulated in S0 y w flies, even though the S0 y w flies remained tumor free. A few AMP genes (e.g., Drs , Drsl , CecA , etc.) are further upregulated in S0 hop Tum-l flies, suggesting that the increased tumor burden in S0 hop Tum-l adults is fueled by ectopic JAK-STAT and Toll signaling induced in space. Unlike their parents, however, naive S1 y w larvae did not exhibit a clear and strong inflammatory gene expression readout (see S0/G0 y w column in Figure 5 D and S1/G1 y w column in Figure S3 D, where constitutive immune signaling does not mask the effects of space). In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active in hop Tum-l larvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1 hop Tum-l larvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1 hop Tum-l larvae. This increased immune reactivity was also reflected in the enhanced T + E scores in infected S1 hop Tum-l larvae, relative to their G1 counterparts. The increased tumor burden detected in naive S1 hop Tum-l larvae did not persist in S1 hop Tum-l adults. Collectively, these observations suggest that, with re-adaptation to normal gravity, the inflammatory effects of spaceflight are transient and reversible. The highly inflamed state of hop Tum-l animals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight. Wasp success, wasp virulence, and gene expression changes We hypothesized that stress from spaceflight could compromise the development of either of the two partners: the fly or the parasite. Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alternative scenario, if the effects of spaceflight on fly hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulent Lh14 species was equally successful in both conditions, while Lb17 survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference in Lb17 versus Lh14 success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence strategies, with Lb17 being less successful on D. melanogaster than Lh14 . 8 Global gene expression changes in space-raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcription of many more genes was affected in S0 Lb17 than in S0 Lh14 . Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufficiently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts. With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on “short life cycle” organisms such as D. melanogaster and their associated flora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be helpful in this regard. The virulence properties of both parasites also appeared to be largely maintained in space. This conclusion is based on (a) comparable yields of parasites in space versus ground cultures, (b) relatively stronger effects of Lb17 on the T + E score compared to Lh14 , and (c) stronger transcriptional activation of Drosomycin ( Drs ) in S1 hosts after Lb17 infection but not after Lh14 infection ( Figures S3 F and S3G). It is intriguing that S0 wasps of both species were less effective at increasing the T + E score in both G1 and S1 hop Tum-l hosts. This result suggests that the space environment did affect wasp physiology or virulence; the latter interpretation being consistent with reported increases in microbial virulence in space. 31 , 32 A clear molecular explanation for differences in S0 versus G0 wasps was not apparent from the molecular analysis of wasp EV gene transcription. Transcript levels of only 29/312 Lb17 EV genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. Only one of the two predicted RhoGAP superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known LbGAP virulence protein, 49 and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. The transcription of only 5/398 Lh14 EV transcripts was differentially affected, with only one gene (lacking annotation) showing ∼ 5-fold upregulation. None of these genes is currently implicated in Lh14 virulence. Furthermore, in an ex vivo assay, Lh14 venom from S0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes than Lh14 venom from G0 wasps. The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0 Lh14 EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0 Lh14 EV is comparable to that of controls. It is possible that the cumulative effects of differential gene expression changes contributed to differences between S0 and G0 wasps. Alternatively, S0 wasps may differ in their oviposition behavior, affecting the quantity of venom introduced into the host. Mutant wasps Haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera makes it convenient to conduct mutational studies in space, as haploid sons (developing from unfertilized eggs of mutated females) would exhibit dominant or recessive mutant phenotypes. In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0 Lh14 males developed in space resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female-sterile. Dosimetry measurements on SpaceX-14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32-day duration in the ISS. Being in low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth’s magnetosphere. 59 Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of radiation, 60 our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction. 1 Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation on Drosophila and Leptopilina may be particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long-term colonization. 1 , 61 Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as-yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space. Studies of other animal and plant hosts and their natural parasites in modeled microgravity and/or radiation will provide insights into their effects on host defense and parasite virulence. Limitations of the study Spaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [ Figure S5 ].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.",
