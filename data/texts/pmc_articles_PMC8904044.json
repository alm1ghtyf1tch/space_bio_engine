    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In Bacillus subtilis , mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in rpoB leading to rifampin resistance (Rif r ) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to which B. subtilis cells or spores are exposed. Rif r rpoB mutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited by B. subtilis . Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specific rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined. IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis in rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.

    "Results": "Levels of Rif resistance conferred by mutant rpoB alleles. The natural environment often contains inhibitory or subinhibitory levels of various antibiotics; thus, natural antibiotic resistance would confer a selective advantage in such environments (reviewed in reference 25 ). Through our studies of Rif r over the years, we have amassed a collection of congenic B. subtilis strains, each carrying 1 of 17 different Rif r mutations in rpoB ( Table 1 ). We measured the levels of Rif r in these strains by measuring the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) for Rif in LB medium by the broth dilution method ( Fig. 1 ). As expected, the wild-type laboratory strain was very sensitive to Rif (IC 50 of 0.06 ± 0.01 μg/mL). All mutant rpoB alleles that had been selected on a high concentration of Rif (50 μg/mL) ( 12 , 13 ) exhibited high IC 50 values of >100 μg/mL, whereas mutant rpoB alleles selected on a low concentration of Rif (5 μg/mL) ( 17 ) exhibited generally lower IC 50 values, ranging from 4 to 84 μg/mL, the lowest of which was still at least 67-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain ( Fig. 1 ). Thus, in the context of growth in a selective environment containing Rif, all the Rif r rpoB mutants would be expected to be more fit than the wild-type strain. TABLE 1.

Growth rates of rpoB mutants in LB cultures. In the absence of Rif selection, it has been noted previously that mutations in rpoB leading to Rif r often exert a fitness cost, such as a lower growth rate as measured in standard laboratory media ( 26 ; reviewed in reference 27 ). To test this notion, we measured the growth rates of wild-type B. subtilis and 17 congenic rpoB mutants in individual liquid-LB shake flask cultures ( Fig. 2 ). It was observed that 10 of the 17 rpoB mutant strains grew significantly more slowly than the wild type ( Fig. 2 ), consistent with the notion that rpoB mutations can exert a fitness cost ( 26 ). However, 8 of the 17 rpoB mutants grew at a rate statistically indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain ( Fig. 2 ). The results indicate that not all Rif r mutants exhibit lowered fitness in LB under standard laboratory conditions, as measured by growth rate. FIG 2. Open in a new tab Growth rates of B. subtilis strains cultivated in liquid LB in shake flasks with aeration. Strains carrying the indicated rpoB mutations were grown as described in Materials and Methods.

Relative fitness of rpoB alleles in LB medium. The growth rate experiments described above were performed on individual strains in monoculture, which may not reflect their true fitness in a complex competitive environment such as would likely prevail in nature. Therefore, to directly compare the fitness of rpoB alleles, we performed, in triplicate cultures, a multigenerational and multistrain competition experiment in which the wild-type strain and all 17 Rif r rpoB mutant strains were competed simultaneously in LB ( Fig. 3 ). At daily (∼7-generation) intervals, the proportion of each rpoB allele in the mixed population was determined by next-generation sequencing of two ∼500-bp PCR amplicons spanning either the N cluster or clusters I, II, and III of the rpoB gene ( Fig. 3A ). At generation zero of the experiment, each rpoB allele was present at ∼5 to 6% of the total population. By generation 35, the wild-type strain came to dominate all three cultures, and the proportion of most Rif r mutant alleles had dropped below the level of detection (∼0.1%) ( Fig. 3A ). Two Rif r rpoB mutants persisted until the end of the experiment, the H482N and A478D variants. Although the growth rate of the H482N mutant was not significantly higher than that of the wild-type strain when grown separately in monoculture ( Fig. 2 ), the mutant appeared to be less fit in a competitive environment ( Fig. 3A ). Interestingly, the A478D mutant appeared to almost disappear from the population by 14 generations, but beginning at ∼35 generations, it increased again in frequency to an average of ∼25% of the population by generation 49 ( Fig. 3A ). This anomalous result prompted us to more closely examine the allelic frequencies of the wild-type, H482N, and A478D strains in each of the three replicate mixed cultures. We observed that in two of the three replicate cultures, the A478D allele behaved like the majority of the Rif r rpoB mutations, becoming reduced to a very low, barely detectable frequency ( Fig. 3B and C ). In contrast, in the third culture, the A478D mutant initially dropped below the limit of detection (∼0.1%), but then starting at ∼generation 35, it increased dramatically in frequency to comprise over 80% of that population by generation 49 ( Fig. 3D ). Closer examination of the PCR amplicon spanning clusters I, II, and III from the A478D mutant arising after generation 35 in the third culture revealed the appearance of a second mutation in rpoB , I528V. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing of the rpoB gene of a Rif r isolate from this culture, strain WN1663, confirmed the presence of the I528V mutation in addition to the original A478D mutation. These observations led us to suspect that during the competition experiment in the third culture, the original A478D strain had suffered a second-site mutation in rpoB , dramatically increasing its competitive fitness. To determine if this compensatory mutation was responsible for the observed increase in relative fitness, both the ancestral (A478D) and evolved (A478D+I528V) alleles were transferred into a clean wild-type background to create strains WN1658 and WN1662, respectively. To test their competitive fitness, the four congenic strains WN1621 (wild type), WN1658 (A478D), WN1663 (evolved A478+I528V, isolated from the generation 49 culture of the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D ), and WN1662 (A478D+I528V, reconstructed in a wild-type background) were each competed separately against the same isogenic wild-type strain (strain WN624, carrying a spectinomycin resistance [Spc r ] marker) in LB medium ( Fig. 4 ). Pairwise competition experiments showed that strain WN1658, the A478D rpoB mutant, was dramatically less fit than the wild type (selection coefficient [ S ] = −1.26 ± 0.35), whereas the evolved isolate strain WN1663 (A478D+I528V) was dramatically more fit than the wild type ( S = +0.84 ± 0.23) ( Fig. 4 ). However, simple reconstruction of the A478D+I528V rpoB double mutation in an otherwise wild-type background (strain WN1662) resulted in only a modest increase in fitness ( S = −0.47 ± 0.05) compared to that seen in the single A478D mutant and failed to replicate the dramatic increase in fitness seen in the evolved strain WN1663 ( Fig. 4 ). We therefore conclude that while the second-site mutation I528V in rpoB increased competitive fitness to a certain extent, it was not sufficient to account for the dramatic increase in fitness seen in strain 1663 arising in the third multiallelic competition culture in the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D . The results lead us to hypothesize that strain WN1663 had sustained genomic mutation(s) in addition to I528V that also contributed to its dramatically increased fitness. These putative additional mutations could be revealed by whole-genome sequencing, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Results from the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 indicated that, when challenged in a more complex competitive environment (18 rpoB variants growing together for 49 generation in LB medium in the absence of Rif selection), all of the Rif r mutations in rpoB led to a generalized reduction in fitness. This result is somewhat at odds with the conclusions drawn from measurements of growth rates of the same strains in monoculture ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that fitness cannot be predicted by growth rate in monoculture alone.

Relative fitness of rpoB alleles in SMM Asn medium. The multiallele competition experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 was performed in nutrient-rich LB medium. However, in nature, B. subtilis is found in soils or associated with plants and their roots. Such natural environments are either subjected to “feast or famine” conditions or are chronically oligotrophic; therefore, cells would need to utilize limited quantities of rarer, more ephemeral nutrient sources. In previous work, we performed OmniLog global metabolic profiling on wild-type B. subtilis and 11 Rif r rpoB mutants to assess how mutations in rpoB could affect metabolic capabilities ( 8 ). Indeed, we found that several environmental nutrients, normally utilized poorly by the wild-type laboratory strain of B. subtilis , were used significantly better by certain Rif r rpoB mutants. In particular, we noted that a strain carrying the S487L rpoB substitution utilized the amino acids l -alanine, l -asparagine, l -glutamate, and l -serine significantly better than the wild type ( 8 ). l -Asparagine specifically has been found to be substantially present in root exudates and plays a significant role in determining the bacterial species composition of the rhizosphere ( 28 ). Based on these observations, we were interested in measuring the relative fitness of wild-type and 17 Rif r rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in a more stringent selective environment. We therefore modified Spizizen minimal medium by replacing glucose with l -asparagine as the sole carbon source (SMM Asn ; see Materials and Methods for details) and again performed a multiallele, multigenerational competition experiment ( Fig. 5 ). Based on its performance in OmniLog metabolic assays ( 8 ), we reasoned that the S487L mutant would fare better in this more stringent environment than the wild type or other Rif r mutant strains. FIG 5. Open in a new tab (A) Population dynamics of wild-type (WT) and 17 rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in SMM Asn liquid medium grown with aeration at 37°C. Data shown are average values ( n = 3). (B to D) Population dynamics of wild-type (WT), D472Y, and H482N strains during the three replicate competition experiments from which the average values in panel A were derived. In the multiallele competition experiment conducted in SMM Asn , each of the 18 strains was initially present at 5 to 6% of the total population ( Fig. 5A ). As seen earlier in the multiallele competition performed in LB medium ( Fig. 3 ), most of the strains carrying various rpoB mutations dropped out of the population during the course of propagation in SMM Asn ( Fig. 5A ). Interestingly, in this experiment, we observed that the strain carrying the H482N rpoB mutation rose to dominate the population, gaining an average frequency of ∼70% by generation 49, followed by the strain carrying the D472Y mutation (∼20%) and then the wild-type strain (∼10%) ( Fig. 5A ). These results were in stark contrast to those obtained in LB medium, where the wild-type strain dominated the population, with the H482N mutant forming a minority ( Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, the strain carrying the S487L mutation, which we predicted would become the most frequent allele, did not succeed in this medium as we had expected but, rather, dropped below the threshold of detection in the population by generation 14 of the competition ( Fig. 5A ). Comparison of the results presented in Fig. 3 with the results in Fig. 5 demonstrated a dramatic difference in the population dynamics and strain fitness of the same rpoB mutants depending upon whether they were competed in the rich LB or the minimal SMM Asn environment. In addition, the lack of increased competitive fitness displayed by the S487L rpoB mutant competed in SMM Asn ( Fig. 5A ) brought into question whether an increased utilization of a nutrient, such as l -asparagine, as measured by Omnilog assay ( 8 ), is a relevant parameter to predict fitness. During multiallele competition in LB medium, we noted that the A478D rpoB mutant rose to prominence in one of the three replicate cultures ( Fig. 3D ), presumably due to a second-site mutation(s). Accordingly, we also examined the frequencies of the wild-type, D472Y, and H482N strains in each individual SMM Asn culture ( Fig. 5B to D ). In this case, all three cultures behaved similarly, with the H482N strain arising to dominate each of the three cultures. This observation suggested that no second-site mutation(s) improving fitness had arisen in the SMM Asn cultures during the course of the multiallele competition experiment. Growth rates and lag times of rpoB mutations in SMM Asn cultures. We sought to further explore the role played by growth rate in the fitness of rpoB mutants by measuring the exponential growth rates during cultivation in SMM Asn of the wild-type B. subtilis strain and congenic mutant strains harboring the D472Y, H482N, or S487L rpoB allele ( Fig. 6 ). In individual SMM Asn monocultures, all three Rif r mutant strains exhibited a significantly increased exponential growth rate compared to the growth rate of the wild-type strain, but there were no statistical differences among the growth rates of the Rif r mutants themselves ( Fig. 6A ). These results were distinctly different from the relative growth rates of the same strains in LB medium, in which the rpoB mutants either grew more slowly (S487L) or at essentially the same rate (D472Y and H482N) as the wild type ( Fig. 2 ). If the exponential growth rate were the sole determinant of fitness, it would be expected that the three Rif r mutants would have risen to dominate the multiallele competition experiment performed in SMM Asn , but this was clearly not the case ( Fig. 5 ). FIG 6. Open in a new tab Exponential growth rates (A) and lag times (B) in SMM Asn of the wild-type (w.t.) strain and congenic rpoB mutant strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L variants. Data are averages ± standard deviations ( n = 3). **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test for multiple comparison to the mean value for the wild type). In addition to the exponential growth rate, the ability of cells to adjust to a new environment is reflected in the lag time preceding exponential growth. In one of the few studies examining this phenomenon in rpoB mutants, it was observed that a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rif r mutant strain carrying an H526D substitution (the equivalent of the H482D substitution in B. subtilis rpoB ) suffered significantly delayed growth following resuscitation from nutrient starvation ( 29 ). We thus compared the lag time of the wild-type strain to the lag times of congenic strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L rpoB variants in SMM Asn . No significant difference was observed in the lag times between the wild type and the D472Y variant; however, both the H482N and S487L variants demonstrated significant increases in lag time relative to that of the wild type ( Fig. 6B ). In fact, the H482N and S487L variants were statistically indistinguishable in their growth rates (increased over that of the wild type) and lag times (longer than that of the wild type). Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 6 indicated that in SMM Asn medium, the growth rate and/or lag time of individual monocultures corresponded poorly with increased or decreased relative fitness in competition experiments. Pairwise competitions in LB versus SMM Asn . To further examine the discrepancies between the observed growth metrics and the results of our multiallele competition, we performed a pairwise competition for each Rif r mutant strain against the wild-type strain in both LB and SMM Asn media ( Fig. 7 ). The H482N Rif r mutant strain showed the most dramatic fitness difference compared to the fitness of the wild type; it was less fit in LB ( S = −0.047 ± 0.01) but more fit ( S = +0.403 ± 0.063) in SMM Asn medium ( Fig. 7 ). The S487L mutant was less fit than the wild type in both media, although its fitness in SMM Asn ( S = −0.144 ± 0.005) was significantly improved over that in LB ( S = −0.337 ± 0.01) ( Fig. 7 ). The D472Y mutant was also less fit than the wild type in both media, but the difference in its fitness between the two media was just above the cutoff for significance ( P = 0.061). Measurements of the relative fitness for each mutant rpoB allele in pairwise competition agreed with the results of the multiallelic competitions in SMM Asn . FIG 7. Open in a new tab Pairwise competition experiments. Rif r strains carrying the variant D472Y (strain WN1625), H482N (strain WN1637), or S487L (strain WN761) were each competed against congenic wild-type strain WN1651 in LB or SMM Asn medium for 21 generations, and fitness coefficients ( S ) were calculated as described previously ( 54 ). Data are average values ± standard deviations ( n = 3). ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001; ns, not significantly different (two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD test for multiple comparisons). Previous work in our laboratory has shown differing spectra of mutations in the rpoB gene across several different environment ( 12 , 13 , 16 – 18 ). The reproducibility of these changes in the spectra of mutations indicates that the environment somehow dictates these changes. Multiple studies have found that mutations in the rpoB gene that confer rifampin resistance can provide a fitness advantage or increased growth rate in the environment from which they were isolated. Several examples illustrate the repeated occurrence of rpoB mutations in adaptive laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli , wherein these mutations significantly increased the fitness of the organism in different environments, including optimized growth on various minimal media and increased fitness at elevated temperatures ( 30 – 32 ). Our multiallele, multigenerational competition experiments ( Fig. 3 and 5 ) showed that the wild-type rpoB allele was most fit in nutrient-rich LB medium, while the H482N variant was most fit in populations cultivated in minimal SMM Asn medium. The different rpoB alleles and the corresponding changes in global gene expression associated with them likely explain the differences in relative fitness depending upon the growth environment. Numerous studies suggest changes in global gene expression to be the cause of changes in fitness observed with mutations in rpoB ( 7 , 33 – 37 ), although one study examining the system-wide impacts of mutations in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa rpoB gene found few differences in global gene expression and attributed mutant phenotypes to increased expression of RNAP ( 38 ). Ultimately, a better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind these differences in fitness will require an examination of global gene expression of these different rpoB alleles in SMM Asn . Which changes in gene expression are specifically responsible for the success of the H482N mutant can only be speculated upon at present, as this particular allele is new to our collection and not yet very well characterized. However, the lack of fitness of the S487L mutant in SMM Asn may be a bit easier to explain. Previous work studying the rpoB -S487L allele in B. subtilis revealed that this particular allele autoinduced the expression of genes responsible for the production of the antibiotic 3,3′-neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), which is not produced by the wild-type strain under the same conditions ( 39 ). This autoinduction of NTD production might place a significant metabolic burden on the organism and may be responsible for the lack of relative fitness observed in the rpoB -S487L allele. The discrepancies between fitness and exponential growth rate reveal that, while fairly simple to determine, growth rate is a poor proxy for relative fitness, as a similar study has found ( 40 ). Simply measuring the exponential growth rate fails to account for differences in fitness during stationary and lag phase, in addition to potential antagonistic or cooperative interactions between the strains when competing for the same resources, such as dramatic acidification of the medium ( 41 ). Our study highlights the danger of conflating exponential growth rates or results from simplified metabolic assays ( 8 ) with relative fitness. Three Rif r rpoB variants exhibited an increased growth rate relative to the growth rate of the wild-type strain in SMM Asn ( Fig. 6 ); however, only one of those variants (H482N) proved to be more fit than the wild-type strain in the same medium ( Fig. 7 ). There are many potential explanations for this discrepancy that could be controlled at the transcriptional level, such as increased probability of differentiation in the stationary phase ( 42 ) or shaping of the environment by an evolved variant in a manner that preferentially benefits itself ( 41 , 43 ). Unlike other results from this study, the increased relative fitness of the evolved strain WN1663 cannot be explained solely by a compensatory mutation in rpoB ( Fig. 4 ). Our data indicate that other changes within the B. subtilis genome must account for the observed sweep of the population by WN1663. The increase in fitness of the A478D+I528V double mutant relative to the fitness of the A478D single mutant is consistent with other studies that have reported the ability of compensatory mutations in rpoB and rpoC to restore fitness defects ( 44 – 46 ). However, these studies did not find increases in fitness relative to that of the wild-type allele. In summary, this study illustrates the fitness impacts of rpoB alleles in different environments, highlights the deficiencies of growth or metabolic metrics of monocultures as a sole measure of relative fitness, and demonstrates the role of compensatory mutations in rpoB to recover fitness cost.",
    "Conclusion": "Levels of Rif resistance conferred by mutant rpoB alleles. The natural environment often contains inhibitory or subinhibitory levels of various antibiotics; thus, natural antibiotic resistance would confer a selective advantage in such environments (reviewed in reference 25 ). Through our studies of Rif r over the years, we have amassed a collection of congenic B. subtilis strains, each carrying 1 of 17 different Rif r mutations in rpoB ( Table 1 ). We measured the levels of Rif r in these strains by measuring the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) for Rif in LB medium by the broth dilution method ( Fig. 1 ). As expected, the wild-type laboratory strain was very sensitive to Rif (IC 50 of 0.06 ± 0.01 μg/mL). All mutant rpoB alleles that had been selected on a high concentration of Rif (50 μg/mL) ( 12 , 13 ) exhibited high IC 50 values of >100 μg/mL, whereas mutant rpoB alleles selected on a low concentration of Rif (5 μg/mL) ( 17 ) exhibited generally lower IC 50 values, ranging from 4 to 84 μg/mL, the lowest of which was still at least 67-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain ( Fig. 1 ). Thus, in the context of growth in a selective environment containing Rif, all the Rif r rpoB mutants would be expected to be more fit than the wild-type strain. TABLE 1.

Growth rates of rpoB mutants in LB cultures. In the absence of Rif selection, it has been noted previously that mutations in rpoB leading to Rif r often exert a fitness cost, such as a lower growth rate as measured in standard laboratory media ( 26 ; reviewed in reference 27 ). To test this notion, we measured the growth rates of wild-type B. subtilis and 17 congenic rpoB mutants in individual liquid-LB shake flask cultures ( Fig. 2 ). It was observed that 10 of the 17 rpoB mutant strains grew significantly more slowly than the wild type ( Fig. 2 ), consistent with the notion that rpoB mutations can exert a fitness cost ( 26 ). However, 8 of the 17 rpoB mutants grew at a rate statistically indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain ( Fig. 2 ). The results indicate that not all Rif r mutants exhibit lowered fitness in LB under standard laboratory conditions, as measured by growth rate. FIG 2. Open in a new tab Growth rates of B. subtilis strains cultivated in liquid LB in shake flasks with aeration. Strains carrying the indicated rpoB mutations were grown as described in Materials and Methods. Results are presented as averages ± standard deviations ( n = 3). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001 (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test for multiple comparison to the mean value for the wild-type strain). Relative fitness of rpoB alleles in LB medium. The growth rate experiments described above were performed on individual strains in monoculture, which may not reflect their true fitness in a complex competitive environment such as would likely prevail in nature. Therefore, to directly compare the fitness of rpoB alleles, we performed, in triplicate cultures, a multigenerational and multistrain competition experiment in which the wild-type strain and all 17 Rif r rpoB mutant strains were competed simultaneously in LB ( Fig. 3 ). At daily (∼7-generation) intervals, the proportion of each rpoB allele in the mixed population was determined by next-generation sequencing of two ∼500-bp PCR amplicons spanning either the N cluster or clusters I, II, and III of the rpoB gene ( Fig. 3A ). At generation zero of the experiment, each rpoB allele was present at ∼5 to 6% of the total population. By generation 35, the wild-type strain came to dominate all three cultures, and the proportion of most Rif r mutant alleles had dropped below the level of detection (∼0.1%) ( Fig. 3A ). Two Rif r rpoB mutants persisted until the end of the experiment, the H482N and A478D variants. Although the growth rate of the H482N mutant was not significantly higher than that of the wild-type strain when grown separately in monoculture ( Fig. 2 ), the mutant appeared to be less fit in a competitive environment ( Fig. 3A ). Interestingly, the A478D mutant appeared to almost disappear from the population by 14 generations, but beginning at ∼35 generations, it increased again in frequency to an average of ∼25% of the population by generation 49 ( Fig. 3A ). This anomalous result prompted us to more closely examine the allelic frequencies of the wild-type, H482N, and A478D strains in each of the three replicate mixed cultures. We observed that in two of the three replicate cultures, the A478D allele behaved like the majority of the Rif r rpoB mutations, becoming reduced to a very low, barely detectable frequency ( Fig. 3B and C ). In contrast, in the third culture, the A478D mutant initially dropped below the limit of detection (∼0.1%), but then starting at ∼generation 35, it increased dramatically in frequency to comprise over 80% of that population by generation 49 ( Fig. 3D ). Closer examination of the PCR amplicon spanning clusters I, II, and III from the A478D mutant arising after generation 35 in the third culture revealed the appearance of a second mutation in rpoB , I528V. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing of the rpoB gene of a Rif r isolate from this culture, strain WN1663, confirmed the presence of the I528V mutation in addition to the original A478D mutation. These observations led us to suspect that during the competition experiment in the third culture, the original A478D strain had suffered a second-site mutation in rpoB , dramatically increasing its competitive fitness. To determine if this compensatory mutation was responsible for the observed increase in relative fitness, both the ancestral (A478D) and evolved (A478D+I528V) alleles were transferred into a clean wild-type background to create strains WN1658 and WN1662, respectively. To test their competitive fitness, the four congenic strains WN1621 (wild type), WN1658 (A478D), WN1663 (evolved A478+I528V, isolated from the generation 49 culture of the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D ), and WN1662 (A478D+I528V, reconstructed in a wild-type background) were each competed separately against the same isogenic wild-type strain (strain WN624, carrying a spectinomycin resistance [Spc r ] marker) in LB medium ( Fig. 4 ). Pairwise competition experiments showed that strain WN1658, the A478D rpoB mutant, was dramatically less fit than the wild type (selection coefficient [ S ] = −1.26 ± 0.35), whereas the evolved isolate strain WN1663 (A478D+I528V) was dramatically more fit than the wild type ( S = +0.84 ± 0.23) ( Fig. 4 ). However, simple reconstruction of the A478D+I528V rpoB double mutation in an otherwise wild-type background (strain WN1662) resulted in only a modest increase in fitness ( S = −0.47 ± 0.05) compared to that seen in the single A478D mutant and failed to replicate the dramatic increase in fitness seen in the evolved strain WN1663 ( Fig. 4 ). We therefore conclude that while the second-site mutation I528V in rpoB increased competitive fitness to a certain extent, it was not sufficient to account for the dramatic increase in fitness seen in strain 1663 arising in the third multiallelic competition culture in the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3D . The results lead us to hypothesize that strain WN1663 had sustained genomic mutation(s) in addition to I528V that also contributed to its dramatically increased fitness. These putative additional mutations could be revealed by whole-genome sequencing, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Results from the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 indicated that, when challenged in a more complex competitive environment (18 rpoB variants growing together for 49 generation in LB medium in the absence of Rif selection), all of the Rif r mutations in rpoB led to a generalized reduction in fitness. This result is somewhat at odds with the conclusions drawn from measurements of growth rates of the same strains in monoculture ( Fig. 2 ), indicating that fitness cannot be predicted by growth rate in monoculture alone.

Relative fitness of rpoB alleles in SMM Asn medium. The multiallele competition experiment whose results are shown in Fig. 3 was performed in nutrient-rich LB medium. However, in nature, B. subtilis is found in soils or associated with plants and their roots. Such natural environments are either subjected to “feast or famine” conditions or are chronically oligotrophic; therefore, cells would need to utilize limited quantities of rarer, more ephemeral nutrient sources. In previous work, we performed OmniLog global metabolic profiling on wild-type B. subtilis and 11 Rif r rpoB mutants to assess how mutations in rpoB could affect metabolic capabilities ( 8 ). Indeed, we found that several environmental nutrients, normally utilized poorly by the wild-type laboratory strain of B. subtilis , were used significantly better by certain Rif r rpoB mutants. In particular, we noted that a strain carrying the S487L rpoB substitution utilized the amino acids l -alanine, l -asparagine, l -glutamate, and l -serine significantly better than the wild type ( 8 ). l -Asparagine specifically has been found to be substantially present in root exudates and plays a significant role in determining the bacterial species composition of the rhizosphere ( 28 ). Based on these observations, we were interested in measuring the relative fitness of wild-type and 17 Rif r rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in a more stringent selective environment. We therefore modified Spizizen minimal medium by replacing glucose with l -asparagine as the sole carbon source (SMM Asn ; see Materials and Methods for details) and again performed a multiallele, multigenerational competition experiment ( Fig. 5 ). Based on its performance in OmniLog metabolic assays ( 8 ), we reasoned that the S487L mutant would fare better in this more stringent environment than the wild type or other Rif r mutant strains. FIG 5. Open in a new tab (A) Population dynamics of wild-type (WT) and 17 rpoB mutant strains of B. subtilis in SMM Asn liquid medium grown with aeration at 37°C. Data shown are average values ( n = 3). (B to D) Population dynamics of wild-type (WT), D472Y, and H482N strains during the three replicate competition experiments from which the average values in panel A were derived. In the multiallele competition experiment conducted in SMM Asn , each of the 18 strains was initially present at 5 to 6% of the total population ( Fig. 5A ). As seen earlier in the multiallele competition performed in LB medium ( Fig. 3 ), most of the strains carrying various rpoB mutations dropped out of the population during the course of propagation in SMM Asn ( Fig. 5A ). Interestingly, in this experiment, we observed that the strain carrying the H482N rpoB mutation rose to dominate the population, gaining an average frequency of ∼70% by generation 49, followed by the strain carrying the D472Y mutation (∼20%) and then the wild-type strain (∼10%) ( Fig. 5A ). These results were in stark contrast to those obtained in LB medium, where the wild-type strain dominated the population, with the H482N mutant forming a minority ( Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, the strain carrying the S487L mutation, which we predicted would become the most frequent allele, did not succeed in this medium as we had expected but, rather, dropped below the threshold of detection in the population by generation 14 of the competition ( Fig. 5A ). Comparison of the results presented in Fig. 3 with the results in Fig. 5 demonstrated a dramatic difference in the population dynamics and strain fitness of the same rpoB mutants depending upon whether they were competed in the rich LB or the minimal SMM Asn environment. In addition, the lack of increased competitive fitness displayed by the S487L rpoB mutant competed in SMM Asn ( Fig. 5A ) brought into question whether an increased utilization of a nutrient, such as l -asparagine, as measured by Omnilog assay ( 8 ), is a relevant parameter to predict fitness. During multiallele competition in LB medium, we noted that the A478D rpoB mutant rose to prominence in one of the three replicate cultures ( Fig. 3D ), presumably due to a second-site mutation(s). Accordingly, we also examined the frequencies of the wild-type, D472Y, and H482N strains in each individual SMM Asn culture ( Fig. 5B to D ). In this case, all three cultures behaved similarly, with the H482N strain arising to dominate each of the three cultures. This observation suggested that no second-site mutation(s) improving fitness had arisen in the SMM Asn cultures during the course of the multiallele competition experiment. Growth rates and lag times of rpoB mutations in SMM Asn cultures. We sought to further explore the role played by growth rate in the fitness of rpoB mutants by measuring the exponential growth rates during cultivation in SMM Asn of the wild-type B. subtilis strain and congenic mutant strains harboring the D472Y, H482N, or S487L rpoB allele ( Fig. 6 ). In individual SMM Asn monocultures, all three Rif r mutant strains exhibited a significantly increased exponential growth rate compared to the growth rate of the wild-type strain, but there were no statistical differences among the growth rates of the Rif r mutants themselves ( Fig. 6A ). These results were distinctly different from the relative growth rates of the same strains in LB medium, in which the rpoB mutants either grew more slowly (S487L) or at essentially the same rate (D472Y and H482N) as the wild type ( Fig. 2 ). If the exponential growth rate were the sole determinant of fitness, it would be expected that the three Rif r mutants would have risen to dominate the multiallele competition experiment performed in SMM Asn , but this was clearly not the case ( Fig. 5 ). FIG 6. Open in a new tab Exponential growth rates (A) and lag times (B) in SMM Asn of the wild-type (w.t.) strain and congenic rpoB mutant strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L variants. Data are averages ± standard deviations ( n = 3). **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 (ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test for multiple comparison to the mean value for the wild type). In addition to the exponential growth rate, the ability of cells to adjust to a new environment is reflected in the lag time preceding exponential growth. In one of the few studies examining this phenomenon in rpoB mutants, it was observed that a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rif r mutant strain carrying an H526D substitution (the equivalent of the H482D substitution in B. subtilis rpoB ) suffered significantly delayed growth following resuscitation from nutrient starvation ( 29 ). We thus compared the lag time of the wild-type strain to the lag times of congenic strains carrying the D472Y, H482N, and S487L rpoB variants in SMM Asn . No significant difference was observed in the lag times between the wild type and the D472Y variant; however, both the H482N and S487L variants demonstrated significant increases in lag time relative to that of the wild type ( Fig. 6B ). In fact, the H482N and S487L variants were statistically indistinguishable in their growth rates (increased over that of the wild type) and lag times (longer than that of the wild type). Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 6 indicated that in SMM Asn medium, the growth rate and/or lag time of individual monocultures corresponded poorly with increased or decreased relative fitness in competition experiments. Pairwise competitions in LB versus SMM Asn . To further examine the discrepancies between the observed growth metrics and the results of our multiallele competition, we performed a pairwise competition for each Rif r mutant strain against the wild-type strain in both LB and SMM Asn media ( Fig. 7 ). The H482N Rif r mutant strain showed the most dramatic fitness difference compared to the fitness of the wild type; it was less fit in LB ( S = −0.047 ± 0.01) but more fit ( S = +0.403 ± 0.063) in SMM Asn medium ( Fig. 7 ). The S487L mutant was less fit than the wild type in both media, although its fitness in SMM Asn ( S = −0.144 ± 0.005) was significantly improved over that in LB ( S = −0.337 ± 0.01) ( Fig. 7 ). The D472Y mutant was also less fit than the wild type in both media, but the difference in its fitness between the two media was just above the cutoff for significance ( P = 0.061). Measurements of the relative fitness for each mutant rpoB allele in pairwise competition agreed with the results of the multiallelic competitions in SMM Asn . FIG 7. Open in a new tab Pairwise competition experiments. Rif r strains carrying the variant D472Y (strain WN1625), H482N (strain WN1637), or S487L (strain WN761) were each competed against congenic wild-type strain WN1651 in LB or SMM Asn medium for 21 generations, and fitness coefficients ( S ) were calculated as described previously ( 54 ). Data are average values ± standard deviations ( n = 3). ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001; ns, not significantly different (two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD test for multiple comparisons). Previous work in our laboratory has shown differing spectra of mutations in the rpoB gene across several different environment ( 12 , 13 , 16 – 18 ). The reproducibility of these changes in the spectra of mutations indicates that the environment somehow dictates these changes. Multiple studies have found that mutations in the rpoB gene that confer rifampin resistance can provide a fitness advantage or increased growth rate in the environment from which they were isolated. Several examples illustrate the repeated occurrence of rpoB mutations in adaptive laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli , wherein these mutations significantly increased the fitness of the organism in different environments, including optimized growth on various minimal media and increased fitness at elevated temperatures ( 30 – 32 ). Our multiallele, multigenerational competition experiments ( Fig. 3 and 5 ) showed that the wild-type rpoB allele was most fit in nutrient-rich LB medium, while the H482N variant was most fit in populations cultivated in minimal SMM Asn medium. The different rpoB alleles and the corresponding changes in global gene expression associated with them likely explain the differences in relative fitness depending upon the growth environment. Numerous studies suggest changes in global gene expression to be the cause of changes in fitness observed with mutations in rpoB ( 7 , 33 – 37 ), although one study examining the system-wide impacts of mutations in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa rpoB gene found few differences in global gene expression and attributed mutant phenotypes to increased expression of RNAP ( 38 ). Ultimately, a better understanding of the specific mechanisms behind these differences in fitness will require an examination of global gene expression of these different rpoB alleles in SMM Asn . Which changes in gene expression are specifically responsible for the success of the H482N mutant can only be speculated upon at present, as this particular allele is new to our collection and not yet very well characterized. However, the lack of fitness of the S487L mutant in SMM Asn may be a bit easier to explain. Previous work studying the rpoB -S487L allele in B. subtilis revealed that this particular allele autoinduced the expression of genes responsible for the production of the antibiotic 3,3′-neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), which is not produced by the wild-type strain under the same conditions ( 39 ). This autoinduction of NTD production might place a significant metabolic burden on the organism and may be responsible for the lack of relative fitness observed in the rpoB -S487L allele. The discrepancies between fitness and exponential growth rate reveal that, while fairly simple to determine, growth rate is a poor proxy for relative fitness, as a similar study has found ( 40 ). Simply measuring the exponential growth rate fails to account for differences in fitness during stationary and lag phase, in addition to potential antagonistic or cooperative interactions between the strains when competing for the same resources, such as dramatic acidification of the medium ( 41 ). Our study highlights the danger of conflating exponential growth rates or results from simplified metabolic assays ( 8 ) with relative fitness. Three Rif r rpoB variants exhibited an increased growth rate relative to the growth rate of the wild-type strain in SMM Asn ( Fig. 6 ); however, only one of those variants (H482N) proved to be more fit than the wild-type strain in the same medium ( Fig. 7 ). There are many potential explanations for this discrepancy that could be controlled at the transcriptional level, such as increased probability of differentiation in the stationary phase ( 42 ) or shaping of the environment by an evolved variant in a manner that preferentially benefits itself ( 41 , 43 ). Unlike other results from this study, the increased relative fitness of the evolved strain WN1663 cannot be explained solely by a compensatory mutation in rpoB ( Fig. 4 ). Our data indicate that other changes within the B. subtilis genome must account for the observed sweep of the population by WN1663. The increase in fitness of the A478D+I528V double mutant relative to the fitness of the A478D single mutant is consistent with other studies that have reported the ability of compensatory mutations in rpoB and rpoC to restore fitness defects ( 44 – 46 ). However, these studies did not find increases in fitness relative to that of the wild-type allele. In summary, this study illustrates the fitness impacts of rpoB alleles in different environments, highlights the deficiencies of growth or metabolic metrics of monocultures as a sole measure of relative fitness, and demonstrates the role of compensatory mutations in rpoB to recover fitness cost.",
