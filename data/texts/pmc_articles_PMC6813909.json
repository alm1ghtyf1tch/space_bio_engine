    "Results": "3.1. Mechanical Characterization For monotonic compression testing, the vertebral strength, ultimate strain, and work-to-fracture were lower than the control group for radiation exposures of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy but were not different than the control group for exposures of 50 and 1,000 Gy. Compared to the control group, for the exposures of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, vertebral strength was 50% and 73% lower ( p < 0.001, Figure 2 ), respectively, ultimate strain was 58% and 77% lower (Steel post-hoc p < 0.05, Figure 2 ), and work-to-fracture was 76% and 92% lower ( p < 0.01, data not shown). In contrast, monotonic stiffness remained unchanged for all radiation dose groups compared to the control group (691.3 ± 179.5 N/mm; p = 0.67, Figure 2 ).

Similar trends, but more accentuated, were observed for the cyclic properties. Monotonic strength of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy groups were less than the prescribed cyclic loading force, F max , and thus cyclic testing was not conducted for these two groups since the specimens would have fractured after one cycle of loading (confirmed by testing a small sample, data not shown). Fatigue life (5.2 ± 0.4 log(cycles); p = 0.50, Figure 2 ), strain to failure (3.8 ± 1.0 %; p = 0.41, data not shown), and elastic stiffness (1273 ± 162 N/mm; p = 0.31, data not shown) for the 50 and 1,000 Gy exposures did not differ from the control. 3.2. Biochemical Characterization The relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) was greater for all radiation groups by nearly twofold, and increased in a dose-dependent manner: by 67%, 95%, 96%, and 108% for 50, 1,000, 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, respectively, compared to the control (42.2 ± 2.3 ng quinine / mg collagen; p < 0.001, Figure 2 ). In contrast, collagen fragmentation was only observed at doses of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy ( Figure 2 ). Fragmentation at these doses was observed on both the software-generated gel ( Figure 3A ) and electropherogram ( Figure 3B ). On the gel, a dark band was visible at the nominal collagen chain length of 150 kDa for samples of 0, 50, and 1,000 Gy. This band began to lighten at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, indicating fewer collagen proteins of this chain size. Also, a “smearing” of bands was observed below 150 kDa, suggesting that there was a greater amount of collagen fragmented chains with lower molecular weights. On the electropherogram, the same result can be observed. The peak fluorescence unit found at 150 kDa for 17,000 Gy decreased by 74% compared to the control (460 ± 72 FU; p < 0.02).

( B ) A representative electropherogram with the results of 0 and 17,000 Gy overlaid. The peak fluorescence unit found at 150 kDa for 17,000 Gy (red) is significantly lower compared to the 0 Gy control (blue). When comparing the magnitudes of the effects across the different (normalized) measurements, for all radiation doses, the normalized values were higher for crosslinking than for vertebral strength ( p < 0.01) ( Figure 4 ). By contrast, the normalized values for the unfragmented collagen chains were not different than for vertebral strength ( p > 0.55), except at the 17,000 Gy dose, for which the difference was significant ( p = 0.03) but small (vertebral strength 0.50 ± 0.06; fragmentation 0.26 ± 0.03) ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4: Open in a new tab Comparison of vertebral strength with two primary mechanisms of collagen degradation: (1) collagen crosslinks represented by AGEs, and (2) collagen fragmentation indicated by a lower fluorescence unit (FU) value indicating less collagen with a nominal chain length, by radiation dose. Data were normalized by the mean of their respective 0 Gy control, and shown as normalized least-square means, with error bars signifying 95% confidence intervals analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc test, p < 0.05. * represents p < 0.0001 for vertebral ultimate strength; † represents p < 0.0001 for AGEs; ‡ represents p < 0.05 for FU. 3.3. Quantitative micro-CT Imaging The micro-CT analysis confirmed successful random sample distribution; there were no significant differences in bone quantity or microarchitecture between the groups. Total bone volume (1.41 ± 0.16 mm 3 , p = 0.71, data not shown), as well as trabecular bone volume fraction (18.79 ± 0.94 %, p = 0.20, Figure 2 ), number (3.92 ± 0.13 1/mm, p = 0.35, data not shown), and separation (256.97 ± 8.81 µm, p = 0.47, data not shown) were the same for all groups. ANOVA results for trabecular thickness were significant ( p = 0.036), however a Tukey post-hoc analysis found no differences between any groups (50.17 ± 68 µm, p > 0.05, data not shown).",
    "Conclusion": "These results demonstrate that the monotonic strength of murine vertebral bodies was only diminished when exposed to ionizing radiation at or above 17,000 Gy. While the relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was greater for all radiation groups compared to the control, the increase in crosslinks measured at lower doses (50 and 1,000 Gy) did not coincide with the observed reduction in mechanical strength ( Figure 4 ). In contrast to crosslinks, collagen fragmentation was only observed at doses where reduced mechanical properties were also observed (17,000 and 35,000 Gy; Figure 4 ). Thus, our results suggest that the fragmentation of collagen — and not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks — was the primary molecular mechanism that caused the observed reductions in mechanical properties in whole bones exposed to ionizing radiation. Our results are consistent with previous radiation studies and provide novel insight into the effect of ex vivo ionizing radiation on bone mechanics. In accordance with previous investigations of cortical bone, we observed a reduction in both monotonic and fatigue properties at a dose equivalent to nominal allograft sterilization of ~30,000 ± 5,000 Gy [ 10 , 15 , 20 , 37 – 39 ], and a reduction of monotonic strength at 17,000 Gy [ 11 ]. While our study is consistent with earlier observations, our findings expand upon previous knowledge in three important areas. First, previous inquiries have been conducted on either cortical [ 10 , 11 , 15 , 20 , 37 – 39 ] or trabecular [ 40 ] bone tissue specimens, not whole-bones. Second, mechanical characterization has been primarily conducted in either monotonic or fatigue loading conditions, not both. Finally, only a subset of these studies has conducted concurrent collagen biochemical analysis, quantifying either crosslinks [ 13 ] or fragmentation [ 10 , 37 , 39 ]. For the first time, we have demonstrated the effect of irradiation on whole-bones (with both cortical and trabecular tissue) across a spectrum of clinically-relevant doses (i.e. radiation therapy at 50 Gy to allograft sterilization at 35,000 Gy) with both monotonic and fatigue mechanical tests, as well as parallel collagen biochemical assays. We expand on the work of Currey et al. [ 11 ] and demonstrate that in addition to a reduction in monotonic strength following irradiation at 17,000 Gy, fatigue properties are also significantly reduced. Importantly, we have demonstrated the doses at which the differences in collagen structure and mechanics arise. Our results provide new insight into the type of molecular change driving the degradation of whole-bone strength and fatigue life following irradiation. While the exact collagen modifications dominating reduced strength following irradiation are not fully understood, we examined the two proposed mechanisms: photon-induced fragmentation of the collagen backbone [ 10 , 20 ] or radiolysis-induced non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks [ 12 , 13 , 21 – 23 ]. Our results suggest that increased collagen fragmentation, and not non-enzymatic crosslinking, is the dominant factor. While no previous studies have quantified the fragmentation of collagen in irradiated whole-bones, our results are in agreement with previous work on cortical bone, which demonstrated that diminished fracture toughness at doses of ~35,000 Gy was a result of collagen fragmentation [ 10 , 37 ]. Expanding on this knowledge, we demonstrate that collagen fragmentation leads to degraded murine whole-bone mechanics at 17,000 Gy, a dose signifiantly lower than the standard for allograft sterilization (25,000 – 35,000 Gy). Our findings emphasize the need for further research into novel radioprotectants that target fragmentation in order to maintain bone strength when sterilizing allografts with radiation [ 10 ]. Importantly, our findings suggest that non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks may play a smaller role in degrading mechanical strength of bone than previously considered. Previously, numerous studies attributed the increase in non-enzymatic crosslink concentration as the primary mechanism for degraded bone strength, specifically in applications of natural aging [ 24 , 36 , 41 ], drug treatments [ 42 ], irradiation sterilization [ 13 ], and diseases such as osteoporosis [ 43 ] and diabetes [ 26 , 44 – 47 ]. While the concentration of non-enzymatic crosslinks does accumulate in bone collagen in these applications, any causation of those crosslinks with respect to degraded mechanical properties has not been established. Here, we observed that despite a substantial (95%) increase in crosslink concentration, we could not detect any effect on vertebral strength. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that an increase in non-enzymatic crosslinks induced via ribose incubation can be used to counter the loss of strength due to the fragmentation of the collagen network, not degrade it further [ 39 , 48 , 49 ]. Taken together, our results strengthen the argument that the contribution of non-enzymatic crosslinks to diminished bone strength with disease and aging plays a smaller role in comparison to other factors, such as collagen network connectivity [ 50 ]. There are some limitations in this study. First, because we tested mouse bone, the direct application of our findings to human bone is unclear. However, as discussed above, similar trends in irradiation-induced degraded bone strength [ 10 , 11 , 15 , 20 , 37 – 39 , 51 – 55 ] and molecular-level changes [ 10 , 55 ] have been seen in other studies across a number of anatomic sites and species, including human bone. That consistency suggests our results are not limited to murine bone. Second, as an ex vivo study, we excluded the impact of any biologically induced responses to radiation in order to explore the extent to which radiation directly alters the mechanical behavior of the bone matrix. For applications of allograft sterilization, which are only conducted ex vivo , excluding cellular effects is appropriate. However, for in vivo applications of radiation therapy, there can be cellular-driven changes, such as reduced bone volume fraction or altered trabecular microarchitecture [ 50 ], which can alter bone mechanics beyond what is reported here. Thus, our method of irradiation is directly comparable to ex vivo allograft sterilization; for doses equivalent to in vivo radiotherapy treatment (50 Gy), our method is only applicable when considering the direct effects of radiation on the bone matrix. Additionally, we performed all mechanical tests, monotonic and cyclic, in compression. While compressive loading is most relevant for in vivo behavior, the response may be different for isolated specimens tested in pure tension. Finally, because our study did not investigate doses between 1,000 and 17,000 Gy, it is unclear at what dose within this range reduced mechanical properties can first be observed. To address this gap, we conducted a post-hoc study for doses of 5,000 and 10,000 Gy (see Appendix ) with the same mechanical and biochemical assays described above. We found some mechanical differences occurred with radiation exposure of 5,000 Gy (and above), but only for cyclic loading: compared to the control, fatigue life was lower by 18% ( p < 0.01) but monotonic strength was not different ( p = 0.12). These ad hoc results confirm previous observations that cyclic loading may be a more sensitive test than monotonic loading for detecting mechanical effects of radiation [ 13 , 20 ]. Clinically, radiation-induced fractures are often observed months to years after irradiation and classified as spontaneous or insufficiency fractures (i.e. fractures which are not the result of a fall or trauma, and more likely due to repetitive loading at low forces over time) [ 56 – 58 ]. As such, it is clinically important to consider mechanisms that can affect cyclic loading properties differently than static loading properties. Furthermore, our findings have expanded our knowledge to show fatigue properties are also significantly reduced with doses as low as 5,000 Gy. Clinically, our results have implications for safe sterilization of allografts and potential radioprotectants. A dose of 11,000 Gy has been proposed as a safe sterilization dose for allografts [ 59 ], as this dose achieves the same sterility level as the current standard dose of 30,000 ± 5,000 Gy [ 4 , 5 ]. However, our supplemental findings suggest collagen fragmentation and associated loss of cyclic mechanical properties can begin with a dose as low as 5,000 Gy (see Appendix ). To mitigate the loss of mechanical integrity, further studies are needed to investigate how to safeguard the bone with a radioprotectant. Several radioprotectants have been considered for their ability to preserve tissue properties following irradiation [ 4 , 49 , 60 ]. Based on our results, we would recommend studies focused on radioprotectants which can prevent or offset the fragmentation of collagen, as these types of radioprotectants may preserve bone mechanics to a greater degree than those which protect against non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks. Our results also have implications for understanding the etiology of the increased fracture risk associated with in vivo radiation therapy treatment for cancer [ 2 , 8 , 61 – 66 ]. We did not observe any change in mechanical behavior for ex vivo dose levels relevant to radiation therapy (i.e. 50 Gy), despite an increase in collagen crosslinks. Thus, direct effects of radiation on the collagen matrix from radiation therapy are not solely responsible for the increased fracture risk observed clinically. From this, we can infer that the cellular processes of bone remodeling due to in vivo irradiation are likely the root cause. Indeed, previous in vivo irradiation studies of bone in a murine model have shown reduced trabecular bone mass, number and connectivity associated with hyperactive osteoclast activity [ 67 – 69 ]. Taken together with our ex vivo observations, cell-mediated changes in bone quantity, trabecular microarchitecture, or tissue material quality are more plausible explanations for the increased fracture risk from radiation therapy than direct changes to the bone material. In summary, we quantified the level of collagen fragmentation and non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks in the organic matrix of murine whole-bones at clinically-relevant ex vivo radiation doses. Our results suggest that the fragmentation of collagen — and not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks — was the primary molecular mechanism that caused the observed monotonic mechanical degradation at 17,000 Gy and above, and cyclic mechanical degradation at 5,000 Gy and above.",
