    "Abstract": "Abstract There is evidence that spaceflight poses acute and late risks to the central nervous system. To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions. Keywords: brain, spaceflight, microgravity, proteomics",
    "Results": "There were nine and 17 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the white ( Table 1 ) and gray ( Table 2 ) matter, respectively ( p < 0.05, log fold change >1.0 or <−1.0). In general, proteins that were significantly altered were upregulated in both areas of the brain. However, there was no overlap between the brain area data sets. If log fold change constraints were reduced to >0.5, the number of proteins increased to 16 and 25 for white and gray matter, respectively. Table 1.

However, there were strong trends for changes in functionally related proteins in both brain regions ( Table 3 ). In the white matter, there was a strong trend for a downregulation of functions related to the formation of cellular protrusions ( Z = −1.98). In the gray matter, there was a significant downregulation of functions related to overall organismal death and organ degeneration ( Z < −2.0). There were also strong trends for downregulation in cellular and neural degenerative functions ( Z = −1.98). Interestingly, there was a significant upregulation in functions related to viral infection ( Z > 2.0). Table 3.

    "Conclusion": "While there do not appear to be enough significantly different proteins in either white or gray matter in this analysis to appear as a significantly activated canonical pathway, there still appear to be common functional themes: (1) synaptic function, (2) intracellular communication, (3) metabolism, (4) oxidative stress and tissue damage responses, and (5) activation of catecholamines. 3.1. Synaptic Function: Plasticity, Vesicles and Dendritic Spines In the white matter there were three proteins related to synaptic plasticity that were upregulated. Calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit α2δ1 (CACNA2D1) is intimately involved in calcium channel trafficking [ 12 ] and regulates excitatory synapse formation during development or after injury [ 13 ]. PTPRF interacting protein α 3 (PPFIA3, also known as Liprin-α-3) is typically found to be co-expressed with a variety of pre-synaptic proteins in neurons but has also been found in astrocytes [ 14 , 15 ]. It is thought to be involved in presynaptic plasticity and synaptic vesicle release, particularly in excitatory synapses [ 15 , 16 ]. Myosin VA (MYO5A) is an F-actin-based motor protein that is also important in the generation and movement of synaptic vesicles. It has been found in dendritic spines and synaptic vesicles and appears to be critical for synaptic plasticity and organelle transport (reviewed in Reference [ 17 ]). Several proteins associated with synaptic function that are upregulated in the gray matter after flight involve vesicle formation, exocytosis and endocytosis. Syntaxin 1A (STX1A) is a soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein that is expressed in most neurons [ 18 ] and is a critical component of synaptic vesicle formation and exocytosis [ 19 , 20 ]. DNAJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 (DNAJC5) is a pre-synaptic DNAJ C-class Hsp40 co-chaperone that is primarily expressed in the brain and retina (reviewed in [ 21 ]). It is part of a complex of proteins that resides on synaptic vesicles and chaperones pre-synaptic SNARE proteins, making it critical during repeated synaptic vesicle cycles [ 22 ]. Indeed, DNAJC5 knockout mice have progressive, age-dependent sensorimotor deficits and the protein appears to be critical to preventing pre-synaptic degeneration via deficits in endocytosis [ 21 , 23 ]. Upregulated within gray matter, dynamin 3 (DNM3) is expressed in the dendritic spines and is primarily associated with regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling [ 24 , 25 , 26 ]. There are three isoforms of dynamin that share about 80% overall homology and have mostly redundant roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and membrane fission [ 24 , 27 ]. The SH3 domain containing GRB2-like 2, endophilin A1 (SH3GL2, also known as endophilin-1) is a potential tumor suppressor gene [ 28 ] that is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in presynaptic ganglion [ 29 ]. However, the primary function of this protein is to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (reviewed in [ 30 ]). Finally, while not directly related to neuronal communication, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit A1 (ATP6V0A1) involves a form of endocytosis in microglia. This protein that was upregulated in gray matter, is involved with the merging of lysosomes and phagosomes during phagocytosis in the brain [ 31 ]. Interestingly, clathrin-mediated endocytosis was significantly and highly upregulated in the liver of these mice as well [ 32 ], suggesting a systemic response. In addition to vesicle formation, several of the proteins upregulated in gray matter after spaceflight have been implicated in neurite and dendritic spine formation. Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon (YWHAE) is believed to play a critical role during neuronal development and migration [ 33 ] and neurite formation during cortical development [ 34 ]. Over expression of this gene disrupts neurite formation through the microtubule binding protein, doublecortin [ 34 ]. Enolase 2 (ENO2) has also been shown to have neurotrophic activity [ 35 ] and is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and neurite regeneration [ 36 ]. Similarly, both dynamin 3 (DNM3) [ 37 ] and SH3 domain containing GRB2-like 2, endophilin A1 (SH3GL2) [ 38 ] that were upregulated in gray matter are involved with dendritic spine morphogenesis and stability. Another upregulated protein in the gray matter is actinin alpha 1 (ACTN1). Expressed in the dendritic spines of the post-synaptic density (PSD) [ 39 , 40 ], this protein is an actin-crosslinking protein [ 41 ] that is involved with synaptic plasticity [ 39 ]. This is interesting because changes in dendrite activity might be related to synaptic plasticity [ 42 , 43 ]. Consistent with the upregulation of proteins related to neurite and dendrite growth is the downregulation of SEC22B (SEC22 homolog B, a vesicle trafficking protein) in the gray matter. Knocking down this protein using siRNA reduced neurite length had no impact on neuronal migration [ 44 ]. 3.2. Intracellular Communication: Myelination and Protein/Organelle Transport Another broad category impacted by spaceflight is involved in intracellular communication. Specifically, (1) axonal signaling that is “insulated” via myelin and (2) protein and organelle transport. Downregulated in the murine white matter, myelin basic protein (MBP) has an important role in the process of myelination of axons, particularly in the adhesion of myelin layers between cytosolic surfaces [ 45 , 46 ]. MBP is implicated in auto-immune responses within the human CNS, and is thought to be a target for T cell activity in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating or degenerative disorders. Its reduction over an extended period is usually associated with glial inflammation activation and proliferation, leading to reactive astrocytosis [ 47 , 48 ]. Interestingly, three important factors found in oligodendrocytes and involved in myelin formation were upregulated in the gray matter: acyl-coenzyme A, a cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) [ 49 ]; 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) [ 50 , 51 ]; and neurofilament light (NEFL) [ 52 , 53 ]. Two components of protein/organelle transport were upregulated in the white matter. As stated previously, myosin VA (MYO5A) is important for organelle transport (reviewed in Reference [ 17 ]). Similarly, dynein light chain LC8-type 2 (DYNLL2, also known as DLC2), originally identified as part of the microtubule-based motor protein dynein [ 54 ], is involved with transporting mitochondria along the axons of neurons in response to local energy and metabolic requirements [ 55 ]. However, DYNLL2 has also been shown to have a variety of other targets including nNOS, post synaptic scaffolding proteins, and pro-apoptotic proteins [ 54 ]. However, there were also two factors involved in protein transport that were downregulated in white matter. Vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) is a component of the “cargo recognition complex” of the retromer complex responsible for the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane [ 56 , 57 ]. Already mentioned above as an important component of myelin, MBP also interacts with the cytoskeleton and/or tight junctions, making it critical for communicating extracellular signaling to the inside of the cell [ 46 ]. Decreases in MBP have been associated with glial activation [ 58 ]. 3.3. Metabolism: Glycolysis and Mitochondrial Function Consistent with our previous results, in the liver and skin of the same mice in which we found that spaceflight had a major impact on metabolism [ 32 , 59 , 60 ], the next broad category involved the impact of spaceflight on the brain, including glycolysis and metabolism. Two proteins involved in glycolysis or metabolism were altered by spaceflight in the white matter. This first one was upregulated. Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α (PITPNA) is involved with coordinating lipid metabolism and signaling [ 61 ], transferring phospholipids out of the endoplasmic reticulum and into other membranes [ 62 ]. Interestingly, an increase in oxidative stress has been shown to cause a decrease in this protein, particularly in the brains of aged or Parkinson’s disease models [ 63 ]. This lack has been associated with neurodegenerative disease, which has been linked to changes in glucose homeostasis [ 64 ]. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an abundant enzyme in brain tissue that is critical to energy metabolism and glycolysis [ 65 ]. In conditions of oxidative stress, GAPDH activity is impaired, leading to cellular aging and apoptosis [ 65 ]. This enzyme can undergo sulfhydration, S-nitrosylation and oxidation, which, in turn, can lead to memory loss, apoptotic cell death and neurodegeneration, noted in ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease models [ 66 , 67 , 68 ]. In the gray matter, enolase 2 (ENO2) was upregulated after flight, also suggesting glycolysis may be impacted. ENO2 is a glycolytic enzyme [ 69 ] found in neurons, neuroendocrine cells and microglia [ 69 , 70 ]. However, one of the few proteins that were downregulated in the gray matter, SEC22B (SEC22 homolog B, vesicle trafficking protein), also complexes with SNARE proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [ 44 , 71 ]. Knocking down this protein using siRNA had no impact on exocytosis [ 44 ]. Instead, SEC22B interacted with lipid transfer proteins, a factor which, when inhibited, has been shown to result in changes in lipid metabolism and transfer [ 44 ]. Simultaneously, four proteins critical to mitochondrial function were also upregulated in the gray matter. The mitochondrial localized enzyme, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), has been linked to cholesterol homeostasis and metabolism [ 72 , 73 ] and can be found in axons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus [ 49 ]. Dynamin 1-like (DNM1L) is critical to mitochondrial fission [ 74 ]. This protein drives mitochondrial division by self-assembling into filaments that constrict around the organelle [ 75 ]. The 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) can also be found in the inner membranes of mitochondria [ 76 ] and is important for Ca 2+ transport [ 77 ]. Interestingly CNP levels decreased in non-synaptic mitochondria in the brains of old rats [ 77 ]. An increase in CNP release suggests mitochondria may be in a calcium-overloaded condition [ 78 ]. Inner membrane mitochondrial protein (IMMT), also known as MIC60 and mitofilin, is important for protein translocation across the mitochondrial membrane, regulating both morphology and protein biogenesis [ 79 ]. Even though the tissues were collected and prepared for analysis less than five hours after landing, it is possible that the changes in proteins related to metabolism are simply a response to the landing and do not reflect changes in the spaceflight environment. To confirm or deny this possibility would require that mice be euthanized in orbit and tissues immediately preserved for analysis on the ground. Indeed, such studies have already been planned. However, in our previous study examining the livers of these same mice, there were significant changes in lipid metabolism indicative of a pre-diabetic state that seems to suggest a long-term effect rather than an acute response due to landing [ 32 , 59 , 80 ]. 3.4. Oxidative Stress and Tissue Damage Responses The changes noted in metabolism are likely related to increases in proteins involved with oxidative stress and inflammation in the white matter. Arginase 1 (ARG1), which was highly upregulated, is an important enzyme of the urea cycle that is generally found in the liver and is critical to removing ammonia from the body [ 81 ]. However, ARG1+ is also commonly expressed by alternatively-activated macrophages and microglia [ 82 ], which tend to be anti-inflammatory. In the brain, ARG1+ microglia have been implicated in amyloid beta plaque removal [ 83 ]. Furthermore, it is important to nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation in microvascular endothelial cells [ 84 ]. In activated macrophages, ARG1+ competes with NO synthase (NOS) for their common substrate, l -arginine, leading to a reduction in NO production [ 85 ]. Not surprisingly, many of the mitochondrial proteins that were upregulated in the gray matter are also involved in the oxidative stress response. ACAT1 expression has been shown to be elevated during conditions of oxidative stress [ 49 ]. Mutations in DNM1L often result in death associated with oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration [ 75 , 86 ]. In vitro, deleting DNML1 from Purkinje cells resulted in increased oxidative damage via the peroxidation of proteins and lipids [ 75 ]. Decreases in IMMT appear to result in increases in ROS levels [ 87 ] and seem to be an anti-apoptotic protein important for the regulation of cytochrome c release [ 87 , 88 , 89 ]. Interestingly, the oxidative damage due to lipid peroxidation found in the interfibrillar mitochondria of diabetic heart tissue was reduced by overexpressing IMMT [ 90 , 91 ]. Increases in the above oxidative stress factors are consistent with the decreases noted in another mitochondrial protein, UQCRB (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase binding protein), a subunit of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [ 92 ] of the gray matter. UQCRB is important in mediating mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are both independent of NADPH oxidase and important for angiogenesis [ 93 ]. Drugs which inhibit the activity of UQCRB reduce the ROS produced by the mitochondria [ 92 , 93 , 94 ]. Although not found in mitochondria, Quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) is also upregulated in the gray matter. QDPR is primarily associated with the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2). This is important because BH4 is a critical co-factor in the generation of all three NO synthases, iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS [ 95 ]. In quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) −/− knockout mice, the biomarkers of folate-dependent oxidative stress such as ophthalamate, spermine, and γ-Glu-Cys all appeared to be elevated [ 95 ]. Given the changes in markers indicative of oxidative stress, it should not be surprising that there were also changes in proteins related to cell damage and death. In the gray matter, at least four upregulated proteins dealing with intracellular damage and/or cell death appeared to be involved. This is consistent with the IPA analysis that found changes in proteins related to organismal death, degeneration of cells, and neurodegeneration. ATP6V0A1 is critically important in mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion [ 96 ]. DNAJC5 appears to have some influence on protein folding and endosomal autophagy, depending on the presence of SGT and Hsc70 [ 97 ]. ACAT1 is instrumental in induction of necroptosis through lipid droplet formation that has been demonstrated to be the initial key event in cell death [ 98 ]. Finally, CNP appears to play a role with caspase-independent apoptosis [ 99 ]. 3.5. Activation of Catecholamines Finally, there were several changes in the white matter involved in sympathetic activity and catecholamine production. As mentioned previously, CACNA2D1 was upregulated in the white matter. Although we did not specifically look at areas within the brain, this protein is active in the periventricular nucleus (PVN) and is involved with sympathetic outflow [ 13 ]. This is interesting because two proteins involved with sympathetic responses were also upregulated in the gray matter. Quinonoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) is primarily associated with the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (qBH2). BH4 is a critical co-factor in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin [ 95 ]. Syntaxin 1A (STX1A) is expressed in endocrine cells [ 18 ] and STX1A knockout mice had decreased circulating levels of the stress hormones, CRH and ACTH, as well as serotonergic precursors [ 18 ].",
