    "Results": "Survival of D. melanogaster after infection with spaceflight samples Fly survival was significantly lower when infected with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens samples compared to the ground control bacterial samples (Fig. 1 ). For the first spaceflight sample (Space 1), survival was significantly different from both Ground 1 ( P < 0.0001) and Ground 2 ( P < 0.0001) samples. The same was true for the second spaceflight isolate (Space 2) when compared with ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in Table 1 . Space 1 and Space 2 were separate samples of bacteria collected from two different plates after spaceflight, and both showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria. However they also showed differences between each other in terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space 1 causing greater virulence changes compared to Space 2 samples. This is discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiological changes induced by spaceflight vs genetic/heritable changes in the bacteria (see below for “Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample”).

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth of spaceflight S. marcescens in fly host after injection In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not significantly different between space and ground samples at hours 0 ( F = 0.9113, P = 0.489), 6 ( F = 0.5316, P = 0.6772) or 9 ( F = 1.169, P = 0.3964) post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 sample was significantly higher in the fly host than the Ground sample ( P = 0.0002) and Space 2 ( P = 0.0011). At hour 15 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space 1 remained significantly higher than Ground ( P = 0.0002) and Space 2 ( P = 0.04), and Space 2 in vivo growth was significantly higher than Ground ( P = 0.006) (Fig. 1b ). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12 h and onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space-flown bacteria, outside the host, show a similar increase in growth kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Host survival after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased virulence after spaceflight exposure (Fig. 1 ), we wanted to assess whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in the bacteria induced by the stress of spaceflight or whether they were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation exposure during spaceflight. After subculturing spaceflight and ground samples of S. marcescens in normal Earth gravity overnight, Space 1-injected host survival was not significantly different from either Ground 1 ( P = 0.995) or Ground 2 ( P = 0.337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space 2 subculture-infected hosts did not show significant differences in survival from Ground 1 ( P = 0.5223) or Ground 2 ( P = 0.113) infected hosts (Fig. 2a ). Full statistical output is reported in Table 2 . These results suggest that the increased virulence detected after spaceflight were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during spaceflight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection of fruit fly hosts.

This value can be interpreted as a magnitude of differences in survival between Level 1 and Level 2 In vivo growth after injection of first ground subculture of spaceflight sample There was no significant difference of in vivo growth of the spaceflight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig. 2b ) at hours 0 (F = 13.41, P = 0.146), 9 ( F = 0.238, P = 0.866), 12 ( F = 0.443, P = 0.731) or 15 ( F = 0.479, P = 0.708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the first ground subcultures in the host (Fig. 2a ). Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since spaceflight opportunities are relatively infrequent, a model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV. 15 , 17 , 39 We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the spaceflight samples by simulating the low fluid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in a perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle. 11 , 13 Host survival was significantly lower for hosts infected with S. marcescens that was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = 4.42, P < 0.0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = 3.37, P = 0.0002) (Fig. 3a ). The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to 1 g Earth’s gravity. 11 Figure 3a therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence in S. marcescens bacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the spaceflight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence in S. marcescens . Fig. 3. Simulated microgravity (SMG) can increase virulence of S. marcescens .

Error bars represent one standard error. In vivo growth of LSMMG S. marcescens There was no significant difference of in vivo growth between the LSMMG and RWV-Control bacteria at hour 0 ( F = 3.551, P = 0.128) or at hour 6 post-infection ( F = 7.493, P = 0.0544). However, there was a significant difference in CFU counts per fly between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours 9 ( F = 20.428, P = 0.008), 12 ( F = 12.455, P = 0.019), and 15 ( F = 18.427, P = 0.009) post-infection (Fig. 3b ). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the spaceflight samples (Fig. 1b ), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points. Infection of Immune Deficiency ( Imd ) and Toll pathway mutants of D. melanogaster Since the increase in virulence of spaceflight bacteria was accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria within the fly host, we wanted to determine whether this was a result of a change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host by weakening the hosts’ immune system for example, or whether the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host’s immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used flies that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways in flies, the Imd and the Toll pathways. 40 , 41 As expected, all Imd mutant flies ( PGRP-LC Δ5 , imd 1 , and relish E20 ) succumb to any Sm infections (including ground control Sm ) much more quickly than either of the wild-type fly lines ( y 1 w* or w 1118 ) as seen in Fig. 4a , since the Imd pathway is known to be critical for defense against infection with Gram-negative bacteria, 42 such as Serratia marcescens . On the other hand, the Toll pathway is primarily known to be important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the viability of Toll deficient mutants ( PGRP-SA seml and dif 1 ) after ground control Sm infections compared to wild-type flies (Fig. 4c ). Compared to ground control Sm however, the spaceflight bacteria Space 1 causes greater lethality in all of the fly lines (compare Fig. 4b vs a, and 4d vs c). Therefore the data suggests that regardless of the genotype of the fly host, whether impaired for immune function or robust wild-type lines, the space-flown bacteria causes greater lethality than ground control Sm . The statistical output is shown in Supplementary Tables 2 – 6 . Fig. 4. Measuring host changes in wild-type and mutant ground flies exposed to space-flown S. marcescens .

RNA was extracted from infected flies 18 h post-infection. The x -axis represents the beta-value, an estimator of fold change, and the y-axis represents the −log10 q value, a p -value adjusted for false discovery rate. Red dots represent transcripts with q -value < 0.05, which are considered significantly differentially expressed. f PCA of ground, space, and sham injected flies shows no major difference in distribution of the groups between the conditions, with as much variation occurring within conditions as between conditions. RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground-reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit flies after infection with either spaceflight or ground control sample of S. marcescens . These results showed that there were few significant changes in host gene expression of known immune-related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types (Fig. 4e , Supplementary Table 1 ). At the significance threshold ( q -values < 0.05), only eleven transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abundance across the treatments showed that there is significant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit fly hosts (Fig. 4f ). It is worth noting that, since the flies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18 h post-injection, this may have biased the selection of flies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to a control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground flies to the ground bacteria-infected flies, there were a total of 11 differentially expressed genes (see Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table 1 for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed genes, only AttA (Attacin-A) is known to be directly related to the immune response. 43 The gene AttA is an antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative pathogens. 43 The most highly overexpressed gene is lola (longitudinals lacking), a gene that is involved in axon growth and guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 44 The next most highly overexpressed gene is vsg (visgun), a gene linked to alcohol sensitivity. 45 Among the most underexpressed genes is eEF2 , is a translation elongation factor, 46 and CG31650 with unknown function. The underexpressed RhoGEF2 has been recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting effector proteins. 47 While only one of these genes is directly related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional differentially expressed genes in the host.",
    "Conclusion": "In this study, we found that flies infected with a bacterial pathogen that had been grown during spaceflight was significantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. 1 ). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the spaceflight bacteria strains (Fig. 3 ). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the first subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. 2 ). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that spaceflight-induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted upon return to Earth conditions. 10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to spaceflight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space-flown pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts, 15 , 16 less is known about how the host immune system may be influenced differently by space-flown pathogens. This is also the first study in spaceflight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen S. marcescens in a live host, as previous studies in the field of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on Salmonella 15 and other microbes. 48 – 50 Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with spaceflight sample decreases survival of flies compared to infection with ground sample of S. marcescens (Fig. 4 ). Studies in spaceflight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria. 51 Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the specific pathogen used. 52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c , Supplementary Table 1 ). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens, 43 so an increase in expression in response to S. marcescens is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected flies compared to ground-infected flies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. Because there is a significant increase of in vivo growth seen in both spaceflight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given that the space-flown bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight influences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on a solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during spaceflight (reviewed in Huang et al., 53 ) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in final cell density. 54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to a surface compared to those in a liquid suspension where there would be a lack of convection, that one should not expect to see a change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in spaceflight. This argument is based on the idea that the bacteria are being affected indirectly by microgravity, due to the change in the physical properties of the liquid media that they are in, and not the effect of a change in gravity vector on the microbes themselves. 55 However, Serratia marcescens is a nosocomial pathogen that can colonize a wide variety of habitats, and undergo significant phenotypic shifts depending on the properties of the growth media, 56 – 58 including shifts in the polarity of the flagella on solid media to produce swarming cells. Because it’s thought that LSMMG may influence cell polarity in some single-celled organisms, it’s at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on a solid substrate. 59 A previous study showed that growth of E.coli and B.subtilis on agar in spaceflight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples. 54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depending on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al. 60 showed that S. marcescens did not change in physical properties on a semi-solid media in spaceflight conditions, they did provide evidence that significant transcriptomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in spaceflight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed in S. marcescens on a semi-solid media in spaceflight provide a basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi-defined media. While there was insufficient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study, a subsequent spaceflight experiment in our lab has been conducted with S. marcescens to further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. A study performed with a different strain of S. marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no significant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG. 61 Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization of S. marcescens under LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. A previous study found that growth rate was not a major factor affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain S. marcescens , 62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may be linked due to common factors that influence both characteristics. 63 , 64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher virulence, 65 suggesting that there is conflicting data that likely varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the in vitro growth at later time points significantly higher in the spaceflight strains than in the ground control strains (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), and there is a significant difference with in vivo growth after infection with spaceflight and ground control strains (Fig. 1b ), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b ). This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Table 1 ). Furthermore, in vitro growth was significantly higher for spaceflight samples compared to ground samples, specifically starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Previous studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient availability can have significant effects on growth kinetics and virulence of pathogens. 16 Current studies in our laboratory are testing whether microgravity treatment confers a specific growth advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when specific nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of specific growth factors from the media. Specifically, it may be possible that the spaceflight and LSMMG environment may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients become limited, such that the low fluid shear environment allows growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease in nutrient in the media over time. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and spaceflight conditions, which has become a field of great interest recently. It has been shown that after spaceflight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence 15 , 17 and that some pathogens are more likely to form biofilms after exposure to spaceflight. 18 Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quantifiable genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence.",
