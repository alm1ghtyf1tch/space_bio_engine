    "Results": "In vivo longitudinal assessment of tibial metaphyseal trabecular bone density showed both load- and time-dependent effects of PWB (Fig. 1 ). The dose-dependent response to unloading was evident as early as 1 week after unloading (test for trend, p < 0.0001). In particular, trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) declined by 18% in PWB20 ( p < 0.001 vs baseline), 9% in PWB40 ( p < 0.001 vs baseline), 9% in PWB70 ( p < 0.001 vs baseline), and 5% in PWB100 ( p < 0.01 vs baseline). Whereas trabecular vBMD remained stable in the PWB100 group over time, longer exposure to unloading led to progressive declines in trabecular vBMD in all groups, with maintenance of the dose-dependent response at all subsequent timepoints (i.e., 2 and 4 weeks; test for trend, p < 0.0001). Notably, we did not observe any plateau in the decline in trabecular vBMD. By 4 weeks after unloading, trabecular vBMD had declined by 34%, 24%, and 23% from baseline in the PWB20, PWB40, and PWB70 groups, respectively. Fig. 1.

Open in a new tab Dose-dependent reduction in proximal tibial trabecular bone density a and moderate increase in cortical bone density b . Data were analyzed by linear mixed model (fixed variable: PWB, experimental duration, and their interaction; repeated variable: experimental duration) followed by pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction. Data represent mean ± SD. # p < 0.05 vs PWB100 within the same time point; * p < 0.05 vs other groups within the same time point. Unlike trabecular bone density, alterations in cortical bone density at the mid-diaphysis were moderate in most groups. In the PWB20 group at the 1-week (0.8%, p < 0.001 vs baseline), 2-week (0.9%, p < 0.001 vs baseline), and 4-week (1.2%, p = 0.008 vs baseline) time points. Also a slight increase in cortical bone density was observed in the PWB40 group at the 2-week (0.9%, p = 0.035 vs baseline) and 4-week (0.9%, p = 0.016 vs baseline) time points. Bone microarchitecture MicroCT imaging revealed that trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femoral metaphysis also deteriorated according to the PWB level (Fig. 2a ). For example, in the PWB20 group trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb.BV/TV) as 48% and 39% lower compared to PWB100 after 2 and 4 weeks of unloading, respectively. Further, Tb.BV/TV in PWB20 was ~40% lower than that of PWB40 and PWB70 at 2 weeks. This decrease in Tb.BV/TV was due to both thinning of trabeculae and reduced trabecular number (Fig. 2b ). Cortical bone microarchitecture at the femoral diaphysis was not altered by PWB (Supplementary Table 1 ). Fig. 2. Microcomputed tomography assessment of distal femoral metaphysis.

Data represent mean ± SD. # p < 0.05 vs PWB100 within the same time point; * p < 0.05 vs other groups within the same time point. Quantitative histomorphometry Deterioration of trabecular microarchitecture was due in part to a decrease in osteoblast surface, which was 65% lower in PWB20 compared to PWB100 after 1 week of unloading. After 4 weeks of unloading, osteoblast surface of both PWB20 and PWB40 were 78% and 63% lower than PWB100, respectively. Osteoclast surface was unaffected by PWB (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3.

Data represent mean ± SD. # p < 0.05 vs PWB100 within the same time point; * p < 0.05 vs other groups within the same time point. Consistent with the decrease in osteoblast surface, mineralizing surface was decreased in the PWB groups. At 1 week, mineralizing surface was 75% and 40% lower in PWB20 and PWB40, respectively, compared to PWB100. This pattern was maintained with increased unloading time, such that mineralizing surface was 71% and 67% lower in the PWB20 and PWB40 groups, respectively, compared to PWB100 after 4 weeks of unloading. PWB did not alter mineral apposition rate (MAR), though bone formation rate (BFR) tended to be lower, with PWB20 being significantly lower than PWB100 at the 4-week time point. Unlike alterations in remodeling activity at the trabecular bone, dynamic histomorphometric outcomes were not altered by PWB in cortical bone (Supplementary Table 1 ). Interestingly, however, periosteal fluorochrome labels were absent in rats that underwent PWB20 for 4 weeks, and may indicate inhibition of periosteal bone formation with longer duration unloading. Accordingly, Ps.MAR, Ps.MS/BS, or Ps.BFR/BS could not be calculated for these animals. Femoral biomechanics Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis revealed modest or no deterioration of functional properties due to PWB (Fig. 4 ). At 2 weeks, diaphyseal stiffness in PWB20 was lower by 17.4% compared to PWB100. At 4 weeks, all PWB groups exhibited lower stiffness; 11.6% in PWB70; 13.2% in PWB40; and 12.1% in PWB20. Estimated modulus was not altered by PWB. Fig. 4. Functional assessment of femoral cortical bone.

    "Conclusion": "We hypothesized that partial reductions in mechanical loading would lead to proportional deteriorations in bone mass and structure in rats, and that deficits would be progressive with unloading duration. We tested this hypothesis by examining changes in bone density, microarchitecture, and strength following exposure to varied PWB levels for durations ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. Our results demonstrate dose-dependent and progressive reductions in trabecular vBMD due to PWB, as well as deterioration of trabecular, but not cortical bone microarchitecture. The strength of current study is assessing skeletal changes induced by PWB at multiple time points. In particular, in vivo longitudinal assessment of vBMD by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) overcomes the limitations of cross-sectional ex vivo outcomes, such as microCT and mechanical testing. Increased biological variability in outbred rat strains, which were used in our study, further highlights the advantage of in vivo longitudinal assessment of skeletal changes following PWB. Accordingly, these in vivo measurements revealed a clear dose-dependent response of trabecular bone density to the degree of unloading. Also, rather than reaching a plateau, all PWB regimens led to progressive bone loss for the 4-week duration of the study. Few animal studies have performed long-duration unloading, thus whether bone loss reaches a plateau remains an open question. The progressive nature of the bone loss raises concerns for long-duration spaceflight in the absence of successful bone-sparing countermeasures. The oral bisphosphonate alendronate attenuated the decline in BMD, but potential side effects, such as gastrointestinal intolerance need to be considered 20 , 21 . Also, advanced resistance exercise device mitigated bone loss, but serum markers for bone resorption continued to be elevated 22 . NASA is planning longer duration missions (perhaps up to 3 years) in the next decades, yet we currently have limited data for skeletal responses to spaceflight durations greater than ~6 months, as well as safe and effective countermeasures. An extreme case of disuse is seen following spinal cord injury. In these patients, bone loss is rapid and extensive, but seems to plateau at ~50% bone loss 2–3 years after the injury 5 , 23 . In contrast to observations for the trabecular compartment, cortical bone experienced moderate or no deterioration from PWB in these young adult rats. While cortical BMD measured by pQCT was significantly increased transiently, the increase was modest (~1%) compared to changes in trabecular BMD. The relatively even spread of cortical BMD compared to trabecular BMD among different PWB groups suggests the stability of cortical bone outcomes following PWB. Our prior studies in female C57Bl/6J mice also showed robust dose-dependent bone loss in the trabecular compartment, while the deterioration in the cortical compartment was similar among different PWB groups 15 . The greater response in trabecular bone is likely due to its greater surface area than cortical bone 24 , which allows more basic multicellular units to occur, which then leads to more rapid and robust responses to altered mechanical loading environments 25 , 26 . Prior studies in the hindlimb suspension model also show greater loss of trabecular bone compared to cortical bone in rats 27 . Another explanation is that to observe tissue and functional level alterations in cortical bone, longer duration of PWB may be needed. The lack of periosteal surface fluorochrome labels in only 4-week PWB20 animals suggests that alterations in cortical bone remodeling may only occur following longer duration exposure to PWB, unlike the trabecular bone that was altered as early as 1-week PWB. Disruption in periosteal cortical bone expansion will likely lead to decrease in the total and cortical bone area, moment of inertia, and ultimately decrease in biomechanical properties. Data from histomophometry suggest that the deterioration of trabecular bone subsequent to PWB appears to be driven by an imbalance in trabecular bone remodeling, evidenced by a decrease in osteoblast activity with no changes in osteoclast activity. This observation is consistent with tail suspension studies in rodents that report decreased osteoblast activity following unloading 28 , 29 . Decrease in osteoblast activity seen in PWB groups is likely due to increased sclerostin expression in osteocytes, which has been observed in unloading studies 30 , 31 . Other studies have shown that hindlimb unloading also increases osteoclast activity, secondary to osteocyte apoptosis 32 , though we did not observe increase in the number of osteoclasts. While this may suggest that even a slight loading by PWB is sufficient to prevent increased osteoclast activity typically associated with unloading in rodent skeleton, further studies are needed to determine whether the cell and molecular mechanisms governing the response to PWB are similar to those reported for other models of unloading. A recent study demonstrated that disuse-associated skeletal muscle transcriptomic profile in mice differs between cast immobilization vs microgravity in the International Space Station, suggesting that different modes of PWB/unloading may also deteriorate skeleton via distinct mechanisms 33 . It remains unclear whether similar mechanisms are involved in the response to skeletal overloading and unloading 34 . In addition to determining possible mechanisms that may respond differentially to varying degrees of unloading, future work is needed to address the current study’s limitations using a single sex and age of rats. Notably, BFRs were higher in female than male mice after 2 weeks of tail suspension 35 . Also, 2 weeks of unloading by tail suspension led to larger deficits in both the trabecular and cortical compartments in male than in female rats 36 . These studies suggest that female rats may perhaps be more resistant to unloading-induced bone loss than males, though this needs to be tested in the PWB model. Also, aging rats have been reported to respond less to unloading-induced bone loss 37 , 38 , suggesting that aged rats may be less responsive to PWB-induced bone loss. Despite these limitations, using outbred Wistar rats for our study added strength as the genetic variation is related to human population 39 – 41 . In conclusion, this study demonstrates dose-dependent trabecular bone loss in rats, following exposure to differing levels of quadrupedal PWB. The skeletal deficits appear progressive, not reaching a plateau by 4 weeks of PWB. Further elucidating mechanisms underpinning this dose response may lead to the discovery of novel mechanostat 42 genes that can respond rapidly to alterations in external mechanical unloading environment.",
