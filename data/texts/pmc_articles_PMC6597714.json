    "Results": "ob/ob mice were pair fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age and all mice were pair fed to WT HU mice during HU. Food intake averaged 2.3 ± 0.0 g/d for two weeks prior to HU and 1.8 ± 0.1 g/d during HU (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). As expected (because of pair feeding), significant genotype, HU, or interaction effects were not detected for food intake. The respective and combined effects of leptin status and HU on body weight, abdominal WAT weight, seminal vesicle weight (an index of gonadal hormone status), blood glucose levels, and serum corticosterone and osteocalcin levels are shown in Fig. 1 . Compared to WT mice, ob/ob mice had greater body weight (Fig. 1a ), abdominal WAT weight (Fig. 1b ), and corticosterone levels (Fig. 1e ), lower seminal vesicle weight (Fig. 1c ) and osteocalcin levels (Fig. 1f ), and no difference in glucose levels (Fig. 1d ). No significant difference in WAT weight was observed in response to HU but HU resulted in trends for lower body weight (p = 0.09) and blood glucose levels (p = 0.06). HU resulted in lower seminal vesicle weight and higher corticosterone levels. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. Figure 1.

No significant difference in cross-sectional volume or cortical volume was observed in response to HU but cortical thickness tended (p = 0.06) to be lower with HU.

Bone volume fraction (Fig. 5a ), connectivity density (Fig. 5b ), structure model index (Fig. 5c ) trabecular number (Fig. 5d ), and trabecular spacing (Fig. 5f ) were not different between genotypes. However, ob/ob mice had lower trabecular thickness than WT mice (Fig. 5e ). HU resulted in lower bone volume fraction, lower trabecular thickness, and a tendency (p = 0.06) for lower connectivity density and structure model index. No significant difference in trabecular number or spacing was observed in response to HU. No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints. Figure 5.

The respective and combined effects of leptin status and HU on histomorphometric indices of bone formation, bone resorption, and bone marrow adiposity in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Fig. 7 . Osteoblast perimeter (Fig. 7a ) was lower in ob/ob mice, while osteoclast perimeter (Fig. 7b ) and declomycin label length (Fig. 7c ) did not differ between genotypes. Mineralizing perimeter (Fig. 7d ), mineral apposition rate (Fig. 7e ) and bone formation rate (Fig. 7f ) did not differ with genotype. ob/ob mice had greater bone marrow adiposity (Fig. 7g ), adipocyte density (Fig. 7h ), and adipocyte size (Fig. 7i ) than WT mice. HU resulted in greater osteoclast perimeter and lower declomycin label length. Mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, and bone formation rate did not differ with HU. No significant difference in adipocyte density or adipocyte size was observed in response to HU, but there was a trend (p = 0.09) for higher bone marrow adiposity. The differences between genotypes in marrow adiposity and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter with HU can be visually appreciated in Fig. 8 . No significant genotype by treatment interaction was detected for any of the measured endpoints in distal femur metaphysis. Figure 7.

The respective and combined effects of genotype and HU on cancellous bone microarchitecture in 5 th lumbar vertebra are shown in Table 1 . Bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were higher and structure model index was lower in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice. HU resulted in lower cancellous bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness, and higher structure model index. However, significant genotype by treatment interactions were noted for trabecular number, trabecular spacing, and connectivity density.

    "Conclusion": "We evaluated the skeletal response to HU in leptin-deficient ob/ob male mice. Based on the observation that leptin deficiency attenuates the positive association between body weight and bone mass (e.g., more weight gain is required in ob/ob mice compared to WT mice to achieve a comparable increase in bone mass), we hypothesized that ob/ob mice would exhibit diminished bone loss in response to HU. However, contrary to our expectations, the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia in ob/ob mice in femur, a weight bearing bone, was virtually indistinguishable from that of WT mice. In concordance with previous studies in WT mice, cancellous bone loss in HU mice housed at thermoneutral was due to increased bone resorption. The increase in bone resorption was due, at least in part, to increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter 24 . Leptin has differential effects on osteoclast number and activity in weight-bearing mice. ob/ob mice have normal or increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter 25 , 26 , indicating that the hormone is not required for osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, subcutaneous administration of leptin attenuates ovariectomy- and HU-induced bone loss in rats by reducing osteoclast number 3 , 27 . On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest reduced osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice. Specifically, ob/ob mice have low serum levels of CTX, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption 20 , 26 . In spite of elevated osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, resorption of declomycin is diminished in femurs of ob/ob mice 16 . Furthermore, ob/ob mice are resistant to polyethylene particle-induced osteolysis 28 . Finally, ob/ob mice have impaired ability to remodel the calcified cartilage network in growing femur, leading to pathological retention of cartilage during skeletal maturation 10 , 16 , 26 . In the present study, bone resorption was increased in femur metaphysis in ob/ob and WT mice in response to HU. In support, we observed an increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. Furthermore, we observed decreases in cancellous bone volume fraction and fluorochrome label retention. Specifically, declomycin label given at the start of the study was lower after two weeks of HU compared to weight-bearing mice, indicating greater resorption of fluorochrome labeled bone occurred with HU. This association between unloading and label loss is in agreement with previous spaceflight and HU studies in rats 29 . HU for two weeks had no significant effect on body composition in WT or ob/ob mice. This is important because changes in weight could independently influence bone turnover balance 30 . Thus, contrary to our expectation, skeletal unloading enhanced bone resorption in leptin-deficient mice. Reduced bone formation contributes to development of osteopenia in growing rodents during microgravity (spaceflight) and simulated microgravity (HU) 31 , 32 . However, suppression of bone formation is bone compartment-specific. In HU mice, cortical bone formation is suppressed 33 , but this is not necessarily the case for cancellous skeletal sites 24 . In the present study, osteoblast perimeter and bone formation rate were not reduced in distal femur in WT or ob/ob mice during HU. Taken together, these observations suggest that HU results in cancellous bone loss in the distal femur metaphysis because resorption increases to levels that exceed the prevailing level of bone formation. In addition to femur, we evaluated the respective effects of leptin deficiency and HU on lumbar vertebra. Cancellous bone loss occurs in lumbar vertebra in rodents subjected to microgravity 34 and the bone loss is due, at least in part, to increased bone resorption 35 . Femurs experience high levels of ground reaction forces in response to weight bearing, and these forces are abolished by HU. Lumbar vertebrae do not generally bear weight in mice. However, lumbar vertebrae are load bearing and HU alters the orientation of the vertebral column to the gravitational vector, changing the direction of the load 36 . Similar to femur, leptin deficiency did not prevent HU-induced cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra. While there were no genotype-specific differences in magnitude of cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra of HU mice, the bone loss in WT mice was due to a combination of decreased trabecular thickness and trabecular number, whereas the bone loss in ob/ob mice was due to decreased trabecular thickness only. Therefore, minor genotype-specific changes in bone microarchitecture accompanied changes in bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebrae following HU. Spaceflight studies in rodents report lower circulating testosterone levels following spaceflight and ground-based HU studies in rodents report lower seminal vesicle weight 37 – 42 . In the present study, HU reduced seminal vesicle weight in both genotypes, indicating lower testosterone levels. Lower testosterone levels potentially contribute to elevated bone resorption and cancellous bone loss 43 . However, in spite of gonadal insufficiency, leptin deficiency typically results in a low turnover skeletal phenotype in ob/ob mice of both sexes 44 . The precise role of androgens in mediating the action of leptin on bone is unknown but antagonism of estrogen receptor signaling was largely dispensable for leptin’s actions in female ob/ob mice 44 . The present results, identifying similar bone loss in HU WT and HU ob/ob mice, suggest that preexisting hypogonadism in male ob/ob mice did not have a major influence on the magnitude of bone loss following HU. Compared to WT mice, MAT levels were approximately 10x greater in ob/ob mice. In concordance with prior work 15 , 16 , 45 , the increase was due to a combination of more numerous and larger adipocytes. HU did not alter adipocyte number or size, findings that contrast with an increase in MAT reported in rats following either spaceflight 46 or HU 47 and a previous HU study by Hino et al . in male B6 mice 48 . However, the present findings are concordant with a HU study performed in male WBB6F1/J mice housed at thermoneutral 24 . Hino et al . 48 performed their study in 10-week-old mice housed at 24 °C, which is well below thermoneutral. This may be important because sub-thermoneutral housing reduces bone marrow adiposity in B6 mice 49 and there is accumulating evidence that mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing impacts experimental results 50 . MAT levels are often (but not always) negatively associated with osteoblast number and bone mass and are increased in humans following long-duration bed rest and in rodents following spaceflight and in some skeletal disuse models 9 , 24 , 35 , 51 – 55 . Osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and some researchers have concluded that adipocyte differentiation impairs osteoblast differentiation 35 . Furthermore, adipokines produced by MAT have the potential to increase bone resorption 56 – 58 . Thus, high levels of MAT in mice could theoretically diminish the skeletal response to mechanical loading by at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, impairment of osteoblast differentiation and stimulation of osteoclast activity. Despite greatly increased levels of MAT in distal femur metaphysis of ob/ob mice, the mice did not differ in cancellous bone volume fraction from WT mice. There were also negligible differences between the two genotypes in cortical or cancellous bone responses to HU. Taken together, these findings add to a growing list of studies that contradict a deterministic model where increased MAT levels invariably negatively affect bone metabolism 59 . These findings also fail to support a model where adipokines produced by MAT contribute to HU-induced bone loss. Cancellous bone volume fraction in femur in ob/ob mice has been variably reported to be lower 14 , equivalent (present study), or higher 17 than in age-matched WT mice. In our experience, cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis in conventionally-housed (room temperature) mice declines with age in both WT and ob/ob mice, but the rate of decline is greater in WT mice. Impaired osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice provides a plausible explanation for slower age-related bone loss as well as reported differences in their skeletal phenotype. Leptin deficiency results in a variety of physical and metabolic changes that could influence osteoclast activity. Metabolically, ob/ob mice have impaired thermoregulation, are hypogonadal and hyperphagic, and often have elevated glucose, insulin, and glucocorticoid levels 16 . In the present study, we limited but did not fully eliminate the contribution of metabolic differences by housing ob/ob mice at thermoneutral and decreasing their food intake to that of WT mice. ob/ob mice preferentially gain fat mass and there is evidence that lean mass contributes more to the positive effect of weight on the skeleton than fat mass 30 . ob/ob mice are sarcopenic, and Hamrick and colleagues have reported a strong linear association between bone mineral content and quadriceps mass in ob/ob and WT mice 14 . Additional studies are required to evaluate the comparative effect of muscle atrophy on the skeleton of WT and ob/ob mice in response to HU. As expected, leptin deficiency and HU each resulted in higher corticosterone levels. Although glucocorticoids influence bone metabolism, Zerath et al . 60 reported that microgravity-induced cancellous osteopenia occurred independent of endogenous corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, elevation of endogenous corticosterone levels did not replicate the skeletal changes observed in HU rodents 61 . While these two studies do not rule out a role for adrenal hormones, it is important to note that parallel increases in corticosterone with HU were detected in WT and ob/ob mice. This is consistent with the similar magnitude of bone loss following HU in the two genotypes. Skeletal unweighting, whether due to microgravity, bedrest, limb casting, or spinal cord injury results in bone loss 62 , 63 . Impact loading imparted by ground reaction forces, sensory and sympathetic signaling, surgery, and muscle loading each influence bone metabolism 64 – 67 . Commonly used models for unweighting the skeleton include HU, unilateral sciatic neurotomy, and limb casting. HU was originally designed as an earth-based model for microgravity 68 and chosen for the current study because (1) it is minimally invasive (i.e., does not require surgery), (2) prevents weight bearing, but unlike limb casting does not prohibit voluntary muscle loading, and (3) in contrast to unilateral sciatic neurotomy, does not directly influence neuronal regulation of bone metabolism. Leptin is a potent stimulator of bone accrual, but the positive effects of leptin on bone formation in mice occur at low circulating levels of the hormone 69 . Similar to mice, weight gain in humans is generally associated with increases in BMD 30 . However, obesity results in hyperleptinemia and the positive association between increased body weight and increased BMD is attenuated in obese subjects 70 . Prolonged bed rest, a model for skeletal unloading in humans, results in rapid bone loss 71 . Bedrest studies are typically performed in healthy individuals but bedrest is sometimes used in management of hospitalized patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. These individuals, who have very low leptin levels, appear to also exhibit unbalanced bone turnover leading to bone loss 72 , 73 . There are limitations to the present study. The study focused on the role of leptin in skeletal response to changes in weight. While impact loading on the hindlimbs caused by weight is important to skeletal health, we cannot rule out that leptin plays a role in other forms of skeletal loading, such as loading mediated through muscle contraction. Furthermore, we performed the present study in male mice. Since estrogen is important in regulation of appetite, energy expenditure and metabolism, future studies comparing the skeletal response of female ob/ob and WT HU mice are warranted. In summary, chronic leptin deficiency in male ob/ob mice resulted in shorter femora, lower femoral bone mass and density, alterations in cortical bone microarchitecture, site- and bone-specific alterations in cancellous bone architecture, and greatly increased MAT levels. These results indicate that leptin plays a critical role in normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Contrary to expectation, leptin deficiency did not alter the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia in the mouse femur. These findings suggest that leptin is not essential for the skeletal response to unweighting.",
