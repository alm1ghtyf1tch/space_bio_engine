    "Abstract": "Abstract Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the sequels of long-term space missions. Here we sought to determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. These data are in agreement with our previous work using simulated microgravity. In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly modulated by microgravity. Our results provide, for the first time, relevant information about the energetic state of OLPs while in space and after space flight. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space missions to the moon, Mars and beyond. Keywords: microgravity, oligodendrocyte progenitors, global metabolomics, oligodendrocyte progenitor energetics",
    "Results": "3.1. Global Profile of the Secretome from the Different Treatments Secretomes of the OLPs kept for 26 days in 1G (1G OLP 26D) or SPC (SPC OLP 26D) were compared to the reference medium (OSM alone), using five biological replicates (see Section 2 ). Their mass spectra were globally examined, then compared one by one for the intensity of their components’ signals, to evidence a specific profile for each of these groups. Altogether, 424 signals were recorded, among which 372 were identified. Table 2 compares in a global way the mass spectra of the two groups of secretomes to those of the OSM alone. They display differences in the number of signals whose intensity is modified. There were more metabolites that increased in the presence of cells (157 and 182 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05) compared to decreased metabolites (90 and 55 in 1G and SPC, respectively; p < 0.05). Importantly, there were 136 metabolites that increased and 62 metabolites that decreased in SPC vs. 1G. Thus, after 26 days, an increase was observed for ca. 60% of the signals present in the secretome of the cells kept in 1G, while this increase was of ca. 40% in space; when these secretomes are compared to the OSM, a larger number of metabolites was secreted at normal gravity than in its absence. The osmolality box plot represents the cumulative signal intensities in cell secretomes. The osmolality was higher in the presence of cells than in the media alone, and was increased in the cells at 0G compared to 1G ( Figure 3 A). Altogether, these results indicate a quantitative and qualitative variation in the secretome of cells at 0G compared to 1G. These changes in intensity do not equally affect all signals: the plot in Figure 3 B (random forest analysis) shows the top metabolites (notably amino acids and xenobiotics) differentiating the OSM 26D medium from the secretomes, either in 1G or SPC conditions.

The random forest analysis ( B ) represents the 30 top-ranking biochemicals in the secretomes. 3.2. Glycolysis and Energy-Related Metabolism The comparison of the control medium and the secretomes from the OLPs grown in SPC or 1G shows that the SPC OLPs secreted about half of the pyruvate and phosphates of the 1G OLPs, suggesting the high energy requirements of OLPs in space. Both the SPC and 1G secretomes contained elevated levels of lactate, citrate, aconitate and malate vs. OSM but at levels between 1G and SPC, indicating a comparable metabolism in the first part of the TCA cycle. In contrast, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate and malate displayed increased levels in both the SPC and 1G secretomes, but with a larger increase in SPC, suggesting a change in glutaminolysis and/or a BCCA catabolism influx in SPC compared to 1G (see TCA cycle, Figure 4 . The scaled intensity figures illustrate how the 1G and SPC secretomes differ for their contents in pyruvate and fumarate. Pyruvate (a product of the glutamate pathway) is one of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production and it was decreased in the OLPs flown to space. It fuels the TCA cycle (glycolysis pathway scheme), which generates energy (stored as phosphorylated and reduced coenzymes), while fumarate and malate are end products in this cycle ( Table 3 and Figure 4 ), as already reported [ 16 ]. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by 0G and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more fumarate than their 1G counterparts. OLPs from both groups secreted high levels of citrate and lactate, although with a slight but significantly higher level in 0G OLPs. ( n = 5).

Differences in Glutamate Metabolism The detected metabolites were classified by their metabolic identity. Our present data confirm that OLs secrete glutamate metabolites into their milieu: α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), (1G), glutamine, and other glutamate derivatives were released at a high level in both 1G and SPC conditions vs. OSM; among those, the release was 40 to 55% higher in space for glutamine, glutamate and α-KG, while 4-hydroxy- and ß-citryl-glutamate derivatives were lower (20–30%). N-acetyl-glutamate was lower in the 1G medium than in OSM but higher in SPC vs. OSM, suggesting a shift from uptake to secretion in 1G to SPC. The scaled intensity block diagrams for glutamate, glutamine and α-KG illustrate that the three of them are released by the cells, and that this release is accentuated by SPC ( Figure 5 ). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by SPC and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more glutamate and glutamine while both groups secreted similar levels of alpha-ketoglutarate (1G) ( n = 5). For box plots, whiskers reflect 5th and 95th percentiles (with the box displaying 25th to 75th quartiles); bisecting line represents the population median, while the plus sign (+) represents population mean; for details, see [ 20 ]. 3.4. Differences in Lipid Metabolism Glycerophosphate lipids (phospholipids) generated higher signals in the cell secretomes and were more secreted by SPC cells vs. 1G cells, consistent with previous observations [ 16 ]. However, phosphatidyl-cholines with short chains of unsaturated fatty acids and lysophospholipids (non myelin-specific species) were also more detected in cell secretome, but at a lower level in SPC than 1G. In the case of sphingomyelins, their levels of secretion were similar between the 1G and SPC OLPs. Taken together, these observations indicate that our OLPs have their developmental program at the very least delayed in the absence of gravity ( Figure 6 ). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Comparison of metabolite utilization by SPC and 1G OLPs showed that in space, OLPs secreted significantly more glycerophosphoinositol than OLPs in 1G. In contrast, SPC OLPs secreted less palmitoyl-GPC than 1G OLPs ( n = 5). The asterisk indicates that this compound was identified based on two of the three characteristics mentioned in Methods. Compounds identified in this manner, have the potential for their future identification by classical structural analysis. Alternatively, a new standard may be added to the library and the biochemical name confirmed.

Space Flight Elicits Higher Respiration Rates in hiPS-Derived OLPs In order to ascertain the effects of space-µG on energy metabolism, we compared 1G OLPs and SPC OLPs. We quantified the OCR and ECAR as measures of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively. We found that five days after splashdown, the SPC OLPs presented significantly higher basal, mitochondrial and maximal respiration when compared with the 1G OLPs, suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand. In contrast, the glycolysis differences were not statistically significant ( Figure 7 ). Figure 7. Open in a new tab Space-flown OLPs and 1G cells were cultured in Seahorse Bioscience V7 plate for 20 h. A higher basal OCR, mitochondrial and higher maximal OCR showed significant differences with regard to SPC OLPs, indicating that the cells were in a higher bioenergetics state. Interestingly, there were not significant differences for the ECAR. There were 12 samples per experiment. Values are expressed as mean + SD. Student’s t -test revealed that these differences were **: p < 0.01 ***: p < 0.001 vs. respective controls.",
    "Conclusion": "We all were born, developed and have lived in Earth’s gravity and, for technical reasons, the effect of gravity has been, so far, poorly explored, although its mechanical effects are germane to the well-documented effect of cell contacts during their growth, development and differentiation. In our current study, we examined the metabolomic profile of the secretome produced by OLPs in space and discovered subtle but significant changes in the metabolite levels of the SPC OLPs vs. the 1G OLPs. Indeed, we found a differential regulation of metabolites in response to weightlessness. In addition, glutamate production and energy requirements were also increased. 4.1. Glycolysis and Energy Related Metabolites The total energy intake of the brain corresponds to 20% of overall energy intake, even though it weighs 2% of a person’s weight. During development, glucose and lactate are the main source of energy for oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) [ 21 ]. OLs use lactate as a source of energy as well as a precursor for lipid synthesis by converting it to pyruvate. Subsequently, pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), or converted to ATP in their cytosol via glycolysis. During development and myelinogenesis, OLs have high energy demands and are extremely vulnerable to energy deprivation [ 22 ]. Metabolic dysfunction is commonly associated with MS [ 23 , 24 ]. In these patients, acute hypoxia-like lesions, mitochondrial impairment and a reduction in complex I and complex IV of the electron transport chain are reduced [ 25 ]. There are several patterns of de-myelination and several classifications of MS. One is named oligodendrogliopathy, where the cell processes of OLs are dying back, and it is the distinctive characteristic for “pattern III” MS [ 26 ]. It has been reported that OLs’ metabolism is impacted by dimethyl-fumarate (DMF, Tecfidera ® ). This compound is being used for the treatment of MS [ 27 , 28 ]. It is believed that it modulates both antioxidant and lipid metabolism in OLs [ 29 ]. Patients treated with this molecule displayed a higher brain magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and this was thought to correlate with the preservation of myelin density [ 30 ]. As observed previously in sim-μG, the OLPs secreted more fumarate and methyl-fumarate (mesaconate) in SPC while maintaining their progenitor stage [ 12 ]. Here, we show that the OLPs exposed to space μG displayed an enhanced need for energy with regard to their ground control counterparts. In addition, more lactate (produced during anaerobic oxidation to fulfill energy needs) was also significantly released by the SPC OLPs. The use of extra energy in the SPC OLPs cannot be explained through a stimulation of myelin synthesis; glycerate, a building element in the formation of triglycerides, was secreted by these cells, indicating that they were still at the immature developmental stage, while the 1G OLPs may have been moving forward towards maturation as previously demonstrated by Tran et al. [ 10 ]. Further studies are needed to ascertain the causes of such enhanced energy consumption by OLPs. 4.2. Glutamate Metabolism The glutamate pathway is a hub: glutamate forms from glutamine via deamination through phosphate-activated glutaminase; it is fed by the glycolysis (with alanine as a by-product); glutamate is also a co-substrate in all reactions catalyzed by aminotransferases, which convert it to α-KG, a key intermediate of the TCA cycle [ 31 ]; glutamate generates energy itself (NADH). Astrocytes are thought to be the only suppliers to the glutamate metabolism in the brain [ 32 ]. Nonetheless, it has been shown that OLs also express high levels of glutamate synthetase (GS) at the level of the midbrain and the spinal cord [ 33 ]. These authors also reported that OLs do not need glutamate for their survival or for their myelinating function, thus indicating that its synthesis in OLs is part of their genetic blueprint, where no neuronal signal is required. GS also catalyzes the metabolization of glutamate into glutamine [ 33 ]. But the most important fact is that the selective lack of glutamine and glutamate in the brain results in the neonate’s death [ 34 ], and the deletion of glutamate in OLs results in the disruption of neuronal (synaptic) glutamate signaling that consequently alters glutamate-dependent behavior [ 33 ]. Our data appear to complement those of the above-mentioned authors: they report that GS expression occurs “late” in their development. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express glutamate at an early, pre-myelinating stage, and OLPs in space secrete more glutamate than in 1G. Therefore, our novel data indicate that not only mature OLs support glutamatergic transmission through GS, but their progenitors may also play an important role in the glutamatergic transmission pathway even before myelination takes place. In another model of cell differentiation, α-KG is shown to induce the demethylation of histones as a cofactor of histone demethylases [ 35 ] and hence influence the differentiation of the cells [ 36 ]. Glutamine, on the other hand, promotes pluripotent cells via the removal of differentiated cells in culture [ 37 ]. The pivotal role of the glutamate–glutamine pair in cell lineage specification and developmental stage maintenance at the OLP stage points to its involvement in the effects of reduced gravity on maintaining them at a progenitor stage, as previously shown by the expression of early OLP markers by our cells flown to space with regard to the 1G OLPs [ 10 ]. Glutamate dysregulation has been linked to numerous pathologies such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, glutamate is present in sera from MS patients at higher levels than in the age-matched control population [ 38 , 39 ]. In addition, glutamate levels increase in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [ 40 ] and the brains of MS patients [ 41 , 42 ]. Moreover, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainate receptors are also upregulated [ 43 ]. Our data show a significant increase in glutamate in the secretome of OLPs flown into space; considering that in MS, OLPs are available around the lesion but they do not mature, it is possible that glutamate is made and secreted by those OLPs. Based on our above-mentioned data, where the SPC OLPs produced more glutamate than those kept in 1G, serum measurements of glutamate levels before, during and after space missions are of the essence to monitor changes produced by space microgravity in astronauts. This is important because the excessive stimulation of neurons by glutamate that can be caused by energy deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium overload leads to an excitotoxicity that is characterized by the exacerbation of glutamate receptors, triggering a cascade of toxic effects that leads to neuronal cell death [ 44 , 45 ] and, consequently, nearly all brain functions, including learning and memory, are affected. 4.3. Lipid Metabolism The knowledge we have on the primary sources of energy for mammalian cells derives solely from experiments performed within Earth’s gravity. These sources are proteins, fats and sugars. Besides being a source of energy, lipids act as signaling molecules to direct OLPs and pre-myelinating OLs to either proliferation or maturation into myelinating OLs [ 46 ]. Moreover, fatty acids (FAS) are necessary for myelin synthesis. Myelin is the lipid-rich membrane that insulates the axons in the CNS, and it is essential for our daily life activities. Its composition differs from cellular membranes [ 47 , 48 ] in terms of their lipid to protein ratio, where lipids account for 70% myelin, whereas cholesterol and glycosphingolipids such as galactosylceramides, sulfatides and gangliosides account for 40% and 20% of the total lipids, respectively. Abnormal or impaired OLs result in severe CNS pathologies during development and in neurodegenerative disorders. In most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature [ 49 ]. In the present study, we found that OLPs secreted phospholipids in a higher quantity in SPC than in 1G, except for certain species of phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, we did not observe differences in sphingomyelin secretion between 1G and SPC. 4.4. Post-Flight Energetics Here, using respirometry measurements, we demonstrate important differences in energy metabolism. The SPC OLPs consumed more oxygen (basal respiration) and were able to increase respiration under stress (maximal respiration), suggesting a higher mitochondria-dependent energy demand, and probably a higher mitochondria content. Based on our previous work, we hypothesized that we would have more OLPs after space flight, yet we had to obtain confirmatory evidence. Both findings, the increased proliferation [ 8 ] and enhanced energy metabolism, are in agreement with our previous report where, using sim-µG, we revealed that there was increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis after 24 h of exposure to sim-µG [ 16 ]. Interestingly, in the case of the SPC OLPs, they showed preferential oxidative respiration rather than glycolysis. This is a different outcome from that obtained when using the 3D-clinostat. The reasons for these differences are currently unknown. Nonetheless, although the glycolytic reserve capacity appears not to have been used, the SPC OLPs still had higher energy demands after space flight. We previously performed the same secretome analysis of OLPs in sim-µG [ 9 , 10 ]. Although there was major difference in the measure of the secretome of OLPs, like time (3 days vs. 26 days) and method (µG in 3D-clinostat vs. SPC), it is interesting to compare the similarities and the differences. In both instances, lipid secretion, especially phospholipids, was increased in µG/SPC. Mitochondrial respiration was also elevated in µG/SPC, suggesting that this increased ATP demand could be necessary to sustain lipid synthesis/secretion, as well as cell proliferation. Comparisons of the TCA cycle-related metabolites were not identical: more fumarate was secreted in µG/SPC, but the α-KG secretion was discordant [ 12 ]. 4.5. General Considerations We do not know how long human OLs would take to synthetize myelin and myelinate axons in space, but we recently showed that these cells expressed earlier OLP markers with regard to the 1G OLPs; thus, the maturation of these cells appeared to be delayed [ 10 ]. Here, we observe another indication of a delayed lineage progression. What we do not know is whether this delay is transient as part of adapting to weightlessness, or it would result in an arrest of their development. Longer studies with OLPs in space could answer these questions. Finally, the Seahorse experiments revealed significantly higher mitochondrial respiration in OLPs after space flight, revealing that OLPs and their progenies remember having been in space. This is a very important point, as the SPC OLPs also proliferated more in 1G after returning to Earth, pointing toward the imminent need to perform epigenetic studies. An important difference with our studies in sim-µG is that the glycolysis was equivalent in the SPC OLPs and 1G OLPs, indicating that they did not need to switch to glycolysis as their last resource for energy. 4.6. Significance Since, in most myelin disorders, OLPs are present but fail to mature, our current study shows that glutamate and energy metabolism are significantly enhanced in response to microgravity. Therefore, both pathways are plausible targets to address OLPs’ maturation in MS, as well as other related myelin disorders and developmental disabilities like peri-ventricular leukomalacia, in order to enhance myelination in myelin-deficient CNSs.",
