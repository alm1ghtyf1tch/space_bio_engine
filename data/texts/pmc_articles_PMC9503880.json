    "Abstract": "Abstract The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R 2 values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R 2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 10 3 CFU per 100 cm 2 , had R 2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.

    "Results": "The microbial population enumerated with traditional agar plate, Petrifilm, and Easy Plate are depicted in Figure 1 . All three types of media were used for the comparison of food products ( Figure 1 A) and built environments ( Figure 1 B for bacteria and Figure 1 C for fungi). Only the R2A medium was compared with the Easy Plate method for estimating the bacterial population ( Figure 1 D) of the ISS samples. Similarly, the PDA medium and Easy Plate were employed to enumerate the fungal population ( Figure 1 E) from the ISS environmental surfaces. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Density distribution for overall food items ( A ), Earth-built-environment ( B , C ), and ISS surface ( D , E ) cultivable microbial counts for all media types. In food-item and Earth-built-environment testing ( A – C ), agar was compared with both Petrifilm and Easy Plates, while in ISS surface sampling ( D , E ), agar was only compared with Easy Plates. 3.1. Cultivable Population of Food Items Aerobic bacterial counts for food items ranged from 10 2 to 10 9 cultivable microbes per gram ( Figure 1 A). The counts correlated well between media types, with R 2 values of 0.94 or greater and no significant difference between the mean bacterial cultivable microbial counts for each media type ( Table 1 , Figure 2 ). The mean log10 differences between media types were <2.5 (i.e., less than 10 0.34 ) colonies in all cases. Paired Wilcoxon tests between film media and agar were not significant but were significant between Easy Plate and Petrifilm media, with Easy Plate having slightly higher cultivable microbial counts. When broken down by food category, only the microbial community of raw poultry did not show a high correlation between agar and film media counts. However, the correlation between Petrifilm and Easy Plate cultivable microbial counts was high for all food categories ( Table 2 ). Table 1.

Cultivable Population of Built-Environment Surfaces Cultivable microbial counts for both bacterial- and fungal-specific media ranged from below the detection limit to 10 6 per swab (per 100 cm 2 surface area) for built-environment surface samples ( Figure 1 B,C). There were no significant differences between mean cultivable microbial counts among the three media types, for either bacterial- or fungal-targeted media. In all cases, mean log10 differences between media types were less than 2.5 colonies (i.e., <10 0.34 ). Similar to the results for food items, the correlations between bacterial-specific film and agar media were high, with R 2 values between 0.96 and 0.97, and no significant differences between the mean cultivable microbial counts were detected ( Table 1 , Figure 3 ). The correlations between cultivable microbial counts for fungal-specific media were lower than those for bacteria, with R 2 values of ~0.73 for both Petrifilm RYM and Easy Plate YM-R when correlated to PDA. Easy Plate YM-R and Petrifilm RYM had higher correlations between them (R 2 = 0.85), but there was still considerable variation in their counts. Paired Wilcoxon tests showed that Easy Plate AC had slightly lower cultivable microbial counts than both PCA and Petrifilm AC, which, as stated previously, was not large enough to cause a difference in mean cultivable microbial counts. The mean log10 differences between the media types were <0.34 (i.e., a non-log difference of 2 or fewer colonies) in all cases. Figure 3.

PDA = potato dextrose agar; PCA = plate count agar. All cultivable microbial counts are per 100 cm 2 of surface area. Blue solid line is linear regression; shading is 95% confidence interval. 3.3. Cultivable Population of the International Space Station Cultivable microbial counts ranged from below the detection limit to 10 3 per wipe for both bacterial- ( Figure 1 D) and fungal-specific ( Figure 1 E) media (per 100 cm 2 surface area). There was no difference between the mean cultivable microbial counts for Easy Plate AC vs. R2A, nor for Easy Plate YM-R vs. PDA ( Table 1 ). The cultivable microbial count correlations were similar in food and Earth built environments for fungi, with R 2 values of 0.73 for fungal-specific media, but were lower than Earth-based studies for bacteria-specific media, with an R 2 of 0.80 ( Figure 4 A). This was due in part to the number of samples that had zero colonies for one or both media types ( Figure 4 B). The samples plated on Easy Plates, both AC and YM, were more likely to have cultivable microbial counts above the detection limit compared with agar media ( Figure 4 B). Figure 4.

Specificity of Media Types for Bacteria or Fungi The differential isolation of bacteria and fungi by traditional agar and Easy Plate methods is shown in Figure S1 . Among the 40 samples tested, 10 samples yielded at least one bacterial colony in Easy Plate AC but were not present in the R2A medium. In contrast, one R2A medium showed growth, whereas the Easy Plate AC method failed to yield any colony. The further isolation, purification, and identification of the bacteria grown in the R2A plate revealed the presence of Sphingomonas lutea . The pure strain of S. lutea isolate was regrown in the Easy Plate AC medium and showed growth. Similarly, among the 40 samples tested for fungal population estimation, 6 samples showed growth of at least one fungal colony in Easy Plate YM-R but did not show growth in the PDA medium. In contrast, two PDA plates showed growth, whereas the Easy Plate YM-R method failed to yield any colony. Further ITS-based identification using blast searches against the NCBI database revealed that these fungal isolates were closely related to Aureobasidium leucospermi and Penicillium rubens , and subsequent growth in Easy Plate YM-R yielded growth, revealing that there was no inhibition in growth in the Easy Plate YM-R medium. For ISS samples, neither PDA + chloramphenicol agar media nor Easy Plate YM-R (which also contains chloramphenicol) isolated bacterial strains, but R2A and Easy Plate AC both promoted the growth of a significant number of fungi ( Figure 5 B). Figure 5. Open in a new tab ( A ) Distribution of bacterial species isolated from Easy Plate AC vs. R2A agar media; ( B ) distribution of fungal genera isolated from Easy Plate AC and YT, and R2A, and PDA agar media. Points are colored by genus. 3.5. Species and Genus Distributions for Bacterial and Fungal Isolates The dominant bacterial species isolated from Easy Plate AC and R2A were similar, with multiple strains of Staphylococcus species and Kalamiella piersonii isolated by both types of media ( Figure 5 A). However, after 7 days of growth, a single isolate of five slow-growing species was isolated from R2A ( Methylobacterium tolerans, Kocuria marina, Bacillus zhangzouensis, Psueodomonas parafulva , and Sphingomonas lutea ) but not from Easy Plate AC, while multiple strains of Micrococcus aloverae were isolated from Easy Plate AC but not from R2A. In addition, the16S rRNA gene-sequence-based species identity was at 97% or above for all the isolates and above 99% for most. Since the ITS is not suitable to define fungal species, the genus-level identification was recorded. The fungal identification for isolates ( Figure 5 B) was similar across the board, with multiple strains of Penicillium, Aspergillus , and Agicarus isolated from R2A, PDA, and Easy Plate AC and YM-R. Easy Plate YM-R also isolated a single strain of Cladosporium and Byssocorticium , while PDA isolated a single strain of Aureobasidium . A more significant difference was the lack of the yeast genus Rhodotorula from Easy Plate AC isolates, whereas R2A plates promoted the growth of Rhodotorula species. We, therefore, plated a Rhodotorula isolate onto Easy Plate AC while also inoculating Easy Plate YM-R, R2A, and PDA with the same cell dilution for comparison. While Rhodotorula grew on Easy Plate AC medium, it was simply not visible to the eye, and the only way to detect it was to plate out random locations from the Easy Plate on different media. This was in contrast to non-yeast fungal species, which were highly visible on Easy Plate AC.",
    "Conclusion": "In general, the use of film media over agar allows for lower costs, greatly increased inoculation speed, greatly reduced experimental preparation time, and much smaller amounts of space required in incubators or counters; these advantages have been discussed in numerous previous reports [ 28 ]. When dealing with high volumes of samples that must be processed in a very short amount of time, film media such as Petrifilm and Easy Plates provide distinct advantages. In processing the ISS samples, plating the same number of samples on Easy Plates took one person 2 h, as opposed to three people taking 8 h to inoculate the agar plates. The use of film media or pour plates requires fewer dilutions than spread plates because it can produce accurate plate counts at higher bioburden levels, which is not necessarily a fair comparison of the time spent. However, in addition to a pipetting step, spread plates require either retrieving a pre-sterilized spreader from its packaging or sterilizing a reusable spreader and thoroughly spreading the sample over the surface without damaging the agar. For upwards of 300 agar plates per experiment, this adds up to multiple hours. In this study, we found no particular advantage or disadvantage to using Petrifilm (3M) vs. Easy Plates (Kikkoman), except for the lack of necessity of using a spreader for Kikkoman plates. The cultivable microbial counts for built-environment samples and food samples correlated extremely well with counts from agar media and with each other. The one exception to this trend was the bacterial counts from raw poultry products, where Petrifilm and Easy Plate cultivable microbial counts correlated well with each other but did not correlate with agar; given the small number of poultry samples (n = 4), this trend would need to be investigated further to be considered significant. The ranges of cultivable microbial counts for built-environment samples and ISS samples in this study were considerably lower, including many samples below the detection limit for one or both types of media, than almost all the previously published studies using film media in other environments. Most ISS samples had low cultivable microbial counts that were below the cultivable microbial count standard for hospital cleanliness (2.5 × 10 2 cultivable microbes per 100 cm 2 , OR 10 2.4 per 100 cm 2 ) [ 32 ]. The correlations between cultivable microbial counts for fungal-specific agar and film media were lower than the correlations for bacteria and ranged from adjusted R 2 values 0.73 to 0.82 for built-environment samples and ISS samples. The correlation between bacterial-specific agar vs. film media was lower for ISS samples (adj R 2 = 0.80) than Earth built environments (R 2 = 0.94–0.98), probably due to both the low bioburden in ISS samples and the presence of considerable fungi growing on bacterial-specific media, which might have masked the presence of bacteria. It is noteworthy to mention here that the increase in inoculum size (1 mL) yielded cultivable counts more in film media (10 samples for bacteria and 6 samples for fungi; Figure 5 ) than the traditional agar(s) used (100 µL). The species distribution for film media vs. agar media was similar between both fungal-specific and bacteria-specific plates. Three main differences were that (1) yeast colonies grew but were not visible on Easy Plate AC (although non-yeast fungal colonies were visible and countable), whereas yeast colonies were of course visible on R2A; (2) Easy Plates isolated multiple strains of Micrococcus , whereas R2A did not; and (3) isolation from R2A allowed for the isolation of single strains of slow-growing low-nutrient-loving bacterial species not isolated on Easy Plates, from minuscule colonies. In some cases, the minuscule colony had a distinct color that allowed us to select it as a colony of interest from the agar, whereas on the Easy Plate, it was not distinguishable from other colonies; in some cases, there was only a single tiny colony on the agar plate vs. no colony on the Easy Plate, which could be due to random chance: In at least two cases, there would have been no way to pick the rare species out, and it was chance that led us to collect it. Inoculating well-grown colonies isolated from R2A onto Easy Plate AC medium allowed the growth of these minuscule colonies. Picking colonies out by their relative size on film media is difficult, as the dye used in Petrifilm and Easy Plates magnifies the size of tiny colonies. Additionally, without a clear view of colony morphology and color that agar provides, it is possible that isolating “rare” species might have been overlooked. This could be an advantage or disadvantage of film media depending on the goals and study design (it removes non-random sampling biases, but if one is sampling non-randomly, it may result in a lower diversity of isolates). Other disadvantages of film media are that (1) because of the smaller surface area and the miniaturization of colonies, it was difficult to count colonies by eye for high bioburden samples, and in a few cases, counting from magnified photographs was necessary (3M has developed an automated CFU counter for use with Petrifilm plates, which negates this issue), and (2) because colony color was not observable, and morphology was somewhat obscured in film media, it would be extremely difficult to rule out the colonies of a known contaminant that appeared also in control plates (for example, in a situation where samples are plated out in the field or in otherwise non-laboratory conditions). Surfaces in built environments inhabited by humans and animals are inherently difficult to consistently sample for cultivable microbial counts, due to having higher fungal:bacterial ratios and the presence of hairs and fibers, which adsorb bacterial and fungal spores, thus requiring multiple replicates to obtain an accurate count. Even with every effort made to vortex or otherwise homogenize samples before plating, in extremely low-biomass environments, the presence or absence of a single hair or fiber might make the difference between a zero and non-zero cultivable microbial count, or a lower or higher cultivable microbial count. Human habitation and the accompanying presence of dust, fibers, and hairs from bodies and cloth, combined with extremely low surface biomass due to constant cleaning and well-filtered air, is a combination peculiar to hospital environments [ 40 ], clean rooms [ 41 ], and space habitats [ 42 , 43 ]; however, because astronauts do not wear masks, gloves, or other protective equipment aboard the ISS, the problem of hairs and fibers is exacerbated. One study tested the efficacy of Petrifilm vs. contact plates on regular hospital surfaces and found that Petrifilm detected larger numbers of cultivable microbes [ 32 ]; however, cultivable microbial counts in that study were higher than what would be considered “low bioburden” (i.e., comparable to a clean room or the ISS). In a study of debris and lint collected via vacuuming the ISS surfaces, fibers and hairs—as opposed to tinier particles such as skin cells with a greater surface area—yielded a distinct microbial community with greater fungal diversity and only one order of magnitude fewer cultivable microbes than powdery debris despite a vastly smaller surface area [ 42 ]. Therefore, the use of a larger volume is critical for accurate plate counts. As film media use a 10× higher volume than traditional spread plates, while not presenting the same challenges of possible heat death (molten agar at 55 °C) and excavation that isolating bacteria and fungi presents when using pour plates [ 44 , 45 ], film media are well-suited for use with samples from the ISS and other future space habitats. In fact, because film media are extremely light, and thin, and rely on water cohesion and adhesion rather than gravity or manual spreading, they may be suitable for testing in microgravity in the future and may be a possible method for both food and environmental safety testing for future space habitats.",
