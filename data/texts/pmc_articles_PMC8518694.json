    "Results": "cdh3 mutation enhances primary root growth sensitivity to cadaverine in Arabidopsis To identify molecular candidates in cadaverine response in plants, we carried out a forward genetic screen using a population of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)‐mutagenized A. thaliana plants in the Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) background. We screened M2 seedlings for altered root growth on media containing 200 µ m cadaverine. One of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive mutants identified in this screen, named cadaverine hypersensitive 3 ( cdh3 ), showed a significant inhibition of primary root growth on cadaverine‐containing media relative to wild type (Figure 1a and Figure S1 ). This mutant is the main subject of investigation in this manuscript. Figure 1. Open in a new tab cdh3 is hypersensitive to cadaverine (Cad). (a) 10‐day‐old Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) and cdh3 seedlings germinated on vertical plates containing 200 μ m cadaverine or control media. (b) Dose–response of seedlings germinated on cadaverine media.

(c) Seedlings were germinated on 200 μ m cadaverine or control media and treated with propidium iodide to stain the cell walls. Stained roots were then analyzed using confocal microscopy. Five seedlings were analyzed per treatment group. White stars indicate the quiescent center. White arrowheads indicate the end of the root meristem.

(g) cdh3 and wild‐type root growths were measured from day 6 to 10 on control or media supplemented with the indicated concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Root growths were standardized to growth on control media for each genotype. Whiskers show minimum to maximum values. ANOVA with Tukey's HSD correction was used to determine significance. Cadaverine decreases primary root growth earlier in the cdh3 mutant than the wild type To characterize cdh3 further, we first plated wild‐type and cdh3 mutant seeds on media containing cadaverine, ranging from 2 µ m to 2 m m , and quantified primary root growth under these conditions. The results demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect of cadaverine at concentrations as low as 2 µ m for cdh3 , whereas a significant effect of cadaverine on wild‐type root growth was observed only at concentrations of 20 µ m and higher (Figure 1b ). At 20 µ m cdh3 primary roots were 58.4% shorter than wild type. On control media lacking cadaverine, cdh3 seedlings showed only a minor decrease in primary root growth compared with wild type (Figure 1a ). In previous work involving wild‐type L er seedlings, Strohm et al . showed that exogenous cadaverine inhibits primary root growth mostly by affecting cell elongation (Strohm et al., 2015 ). They also demonstrated the existence of substantial natural variation between Arabidopsis accessions in their primary root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine (Strohm et al., 2015 ). Therefore, we tested the effects of exogenous cadaverine on wild‐type Col‐0, analyzing cell elongation and apical root meristem size. Eight‐day‐old seedlings were grown on 200 µ m cadaverine or control media, and roots were treated with propidium iodide, a cell‐wall stain (Strohm et al., 2015 ), to determine cell sizes and zone boundaries in the root tip. The decrease in primary root growth was found to be mostly associated with alterations in cell size within the elongation zone (Figure S2 ), whereas the number of cells in the root apical meristem was not substantially affected in the wild type (Figure 1c–e ). However, cdh3 showed a significantly smaller root meristem upon cadaverine treatment, while cdh3 grown on control media showed an equal number of cells compared with wild type. In addition to decreased cell division and cell expansion in cdh3 , propidium iodide permeated a number of cells within the elongation zone, suggesting cell death (Figure 1c ). We next wanted to determine the time at which cell elongation is modified following cadaverine treatment by measuring changes in tip growth over time. Five‐day‐old seedlings were transferred on to split agar plates containing control or 200 µ m cadaverine media and imaged for 4 days using a high‐resolution camera. Wild‐type roots began to show a significant decrease in tip growth after 96 h of cadaverine treatment. cdh3 , on the other hand, showed a decrease in root tip growth already 40 h after onset of cadaverine treatment (Figure 1f ). Therefore, the cdh3 mutation substantially increases the speed of root‐tip response to exogenous cadaverine. Because arginine‐derived polyamines, such as putrescine and putrescine‐derived spermidine and spermine, were previously shown to also affect primary root growth in young Arabidopsis seedlings, we tested ability of cdh3 to respond to these polyamines as well (Liu et al., 2014 ; Strohm et al., 2015 ). The results demonstrated that cdh3 and wild type show similar root‐growth response to putrescine and spermine, with cdh3 showing only a mild resistance to 500 µ m spermidine (Figure 1g ). Hence, the cdh3 mutation increases root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, and it has little to no effect on root responses to putrescine and putrescine‐derived polyamines. Taken together, our data indicate that cdh3 alters a mechanism involved in the control of primary root growth in response to cadaverine, a process that targets the regulation of anisotropic cell expansion occurring in the main elongation zone as well as the meristem. cdh3 ’s enhanced cadaverine response is the result of a mutation in BIO3‐BIO1 To evaluate the genetic makeup of cdh3 , we backcrossed it to Col‐0, and self‐pollinated the corresponding F1. Segregating F2 progeny were investigated for root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine. Results showed 22.6% seedlings (12 of 53) exhibiting hypersensitive cadaverine response, consistent with a single, recessive mutation (chi‐squared value of 0.1179; P ˜ 0.3). To clone CDH3 , we generated a pool of 162 cadaverine‐hypersensitive cdh3 F2 seedlings from this segregating population, extracted DNA from this pool, and subjected it to whole genome next‐generation sequencing. The candidate mutation was mapped to a 4.6 Mb region of chromosome 5, using the approach described in Schneeberger et al. ( 2009 ). Within this region, a non‐synonymous mutation was found within the BIO3‐BIO1 gene ( At5G57590 ), which encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in biotin synthesis (Cobessi et al., 2012 ). This mutation resulted in an A662T amino acid change within the BIO1 catalytic pocket of the protein (Figure 2a,b ), which functions as an aminotransferase that catalyzes the conversion of KAPA into DAPA within the pathway. The A662 amino acid is located in close proximity to the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)‐cofactor binding site, potentially affecting enzymatic activity (Figure 2c ). Figure 2. Open in a new tab cdh3 contains a mutation in BIO3‐BIO1 . (a) Next‐generation sequencing revealed a peak on chromosome 5 with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with the reference sequence. Table shows mutations within the 4.6‐Mb peak region containing non‐synonymous SNPs in protein‐coding genes. (b) Gene structure for BIO3‐BIO1 is shown indicating the position of the SNP in cdh3 .

(d) Quantification of standardized root growth on control and 200 μ m cadaverine‐containing media from day 6 to 10 of wild‐type, cdh3 , or cdh3 transformation–rescue lines ( cdh3 [ BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 ]) with the wild type BIO3‐BIO1 transgene under the control of its native promoter. BIO3‐BIO1 rescue lines are at the T3 generation. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) 2.54 cm ± 0.045; cdh3 2.05 cm ± 0.073 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 1 2.73 cm ± 0.075; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 2 2.37 cm ± 0.104 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 3 2.36 cm ± 0.063 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 4 2.53 cm ± 0.073 cm.

Bars represent standard error, with dots showing biological replicates. (d,e) Significant differences between groups detected using ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction ( P < 0.05), are indicated with distinct letters. To confirm the association of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype of cdh3 with the A662T mutation in BIO3‐BIO1 , we transformed a wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 transgene under the control of its native promoter into cdh3 . Four independent, homozygous transgenic lines ( cdh3 [ BIO3‐BIO1pro :: BIO3‐BIO1 ]) were recovered and screened on cadaverine‐containing media. Results shown in Figure 2d demonstrated rescue of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype of cdh3 by the wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1pro :: BIO3‐BIO1 transgene in all four independent lines. Furthermore, the transgene also rescued the decreased root‐growth phenotype displayed by cdh3 on control media, suggesting the corresponding A662T mutation in BIO3‐BIO1 was also responsible for cdh3 root‐growth restriction on control media (Figure 1a ). While performing these transformation–rescue experiments, we also noted that three of the four transformation–rescue lines (lines 1, 3, and 4) displayed increased root‐growth resistance to cadaverine, a phenotype that is opposite to the hypersensitive response displayed by cdh3 . To determine if the transformation–rescue lines displayed increased transgene expression level, BIO3‐BIO1 expression was quantified using reverse transcription (RT)‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on 8‐day‐old seedlings grown on control media. While no significant expression alterations were found between cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings, transformation–rescue lines displayed 4.5–14.8‐fold increases in BIO3‐BIO1 expression relative to wild type (Figure 2e ). The level of root‐growth insensitivity to cadaverine correlated with increased expression in resistant transformation–rescue lines ( R 2 = 0.68). Taken together, these results suggest dosage of BIO3‐BIO1 affects the root‐growth response to cadaverine. Cadaverine response is chemically suppressed by biotin Initial studies with the embryo‐lethal bio1‐1 mutant showed that knockout of biotin synthesis in plants can be rescued by application of exogenous biotin (Schneider et al., 1989 ). To determine if cdh3 ’s hypersensitive root‐growth response to cadaverine is the result of decreased biotin, we supplemented 200 μ m cadaverine‐containing media with biotin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 n m (Schneider et al., 1989 ). The cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype displayed by cdh3 roots was rescued in a dose‐dependent manner to near wild‐type root growth by addition of biotin (Figure 3a ). In addition, the inhibitory effect of cadaverine on wild‐type root growth was also suppressed by addition of 80 n m biotin to the medium (Figure 3a ). These data are compatible with cadaverine targeting the biotin pathway or modulating biotin availability or function. Alternatively, cadaverine and biotin could function through parallel pathways to modify primary root growth. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Biotin suppresses wild‐type primary root growth response to cadaverine (Cad) and rescues the hypersensitive root growth response of cdh3 .

(b–d) Significance was determined using ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction. Different letters indicate statistically different groups ( P < 0.05). Whiskers show minimum to maximum values. To identify a step in the biotin synthesis pathway that may be potentially affected by cadaverine, we tested intermediate compounds of the biotin biosynthesis pathway for their abilities to suppress root‐growth response to cadaverine. Figure 3b shows that addition of 1 μ m DAPA, the product of BIO1 activity, resulted in complete suppression of cadaverine's effects on root growth, whereas addition of 1 μ m KAPA, the BIO1 substrate, did not. These results suggest that BIO2, BIO3, and BIO4 functions are not impaired by cadaverine. Rather, BIO1 enzymatic activity, channeling of DAPA to the BIO3 active site, or KAPA’s availability or transport, is/are inhibited by cadaverine. As root‐growth response to cadaverine can be alleviated by biotin supplementation in both cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings, we tested if we could identify cadaverine‐hypersensitive lines that cannot be rescued by biotin, thereby identifying downstream regulators in the cadaverine‐response pathway. ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 mutant, oct1‐1 , and POLYAMINE OXIDASE 4 mutant, pao4‐1 , have been shown to be hypersensitive to cadaverine (Liu et al., 2014 ; Strohm et al., 2015 ). oct1 and pao4 mutants were tested for chemical rescue on biotin‐ and cadaverine‐containing media. As shown in Figure 3c,d oct1 and pao4 mutant roots no longer displayed cadaverine hypersensitivity in the presence of biotin. Hence, biotin appears to function downstream of, or parallel to, OCT1 and PAO4 in the cadaverine‐response pathway. Cadaverine directly modulates biotin synthesis by altering BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic activity As the results of the chemical rescue experiment suggest that cadaverine may target DAPA synthase, we expressed wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 recombinant protein in vitro to test whether its enzymatic activity was fully functional upon cadaverine treatment. Previous in vitro studies by Cobessi et al ., have shown that the product of the BIO1 reaction, DAPA, is channeled from the BIO1 active site to the BIO3 active site, and thus not released into the solution. Therefore, we chose to detect the product of BIO3, DTB using a FRET‐based competition assay, in which DTB will displace the lower affinity 4′‐hydroxyazobenzene‐2‐carboxylic acid quencher from fluorescently tagged avidin (Batchelor et al., 2007 ). We set up in vitro reactions in the presence or absence of cadaverine to determine whether cadaverine alters the enzyme activity. The result shown in Figure 4a indicates less formation of DTB in reactions containing cadaverine compared with control. The data suggest that cadaverine affects the flow of molecules through the biotin synthesis pathway at the level of DAPA or DTB synthesis, leading to decreased biotin synthesis and altered root growth. Attempts to express the cdh3 mutant protein in vitro were unsucessful, suggesting the A662T mutation may affect BIO3‐BIO1 protein stability. Figure 4. Open in a new tab Cadaverine (Cad) inhibits BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic activity. (a) BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity‐purified. In vitro enzymatic assays contained 50 μ m cadaverine and 20 μ m KAPA. A negative control assay was carried out with 0 μ m KAPA with or without 50 μ m cadaverine, to control for background fluorescence (see Experimental procedures). Reactions were run for 8 min before heat‐treating to stop the reaction. * P < 0.05 based on Student’s t ‐test.

BIO3‐BIO1 expression was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction on cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from 8‐day‐old seedlings germinated on 200 μ m cadaverine or control media, or transferred to cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h.

(c) BIO3‐BIO1 protein expression was quantified using a western‐blot approach. 8‐day‐old seedlings were grown on cadaverine‐containing media for 72 h. Proteins were extracted from whole seedlings and run on a sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Following electro‐transfer, the PVDF membrane was exposed to a BIO3‐BIO1‐specific antibody to determine protein level. An antibody directed against a proteasomal protein, RPT4A was also used as a loading control. Blot shown here is representative of three biological replicates that gave similar results. In each blot, band intensities were quantified and standardized to RPT4A for each lane. Results of these quantifications are plotted in the graph shown to the right of the blot, with the value of each biological replicate shown as a symbol indicated in the key. Bars indicate standard error. ** P < 0.01 using Student’s t ‐test against Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) on control condition. BIO3‐BIO1 transcript and protein are unaffected by cadaverine treatment To determine if cadaverine also affects the regulation of BIO3‐BIO1 expression, we next quantified the levels of BIO3‐BIO1 transcripts in control and cadaverine‐treated wild‐type and cdh3 seedlings. RNA was extracted from whole seedlings germinated on cadaverine‐containing media, or treated with cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h, along with controls grown on cadaverine‐free medium. No significant differences were identified between cadaverine‐treated and control samples, or between cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings (Figure 4b ). In addition, cadaverine did not influence the expression of other biotin synthesis genes, BIO4 ( At5G04620 ) and BIO2 ( At2G43360 ) (Figure S3 ). This result contrasts with an earlier report that showed increased BIO2 expression upon biotin depletion (Patton et al., 1996 ). Together, these data suggest that cadaverine‐induced inhibition of biotin synthesis under our conditions is not sufficiently severe to result in increased BIO2 expression. To investigate a potential effect of cadaverine on BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance, wild‐type, cdh3 , and cdh3 [ BIO3‐BIO1pro :: BIO3‐BIO1 ] rescue line #2 were germinated and grown on either control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Proteins were extracted from dissected root and shoot tissues, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blot analysis, probing with a BIO3‐BIO1‐specific antibody (Cobessi et al., 2012 ). The cdh3 [ BIO3‐BIO1pro :: BIO3‐BIO1 ] rescue line expressed increased amounts of BIO3‐BIO1 protein relative to wild type, irrespective of cadaverine treatment (Figure 4c ), consistent with its increased BIO3‐BIO1 transcripts (Figure 2e ). Minimal differences in relative BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance were observed between cadaverine‐treated and control samples for all genotypes and tissues tested (Figure 4c ), suggesting that cadaverine has limited impacts on overall expression of the BIO3‐BIO1 protein in Arabidopsis. Cadaverine treatment decreases the biotinylation of biotin carboxyl carrier proteins in planta Considering that cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis, we hypothesized that treating Arabidopsis seedlings with cadaverine should result in decreased biotinylation of target proteins in plant tissues. Previous studies have shown that probing Western blot membranes with a streptavidin probe allows the detection of a minimum of three biotinylated plant proteins, including MCCA, involved in amino acid metabolism, and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein 1 and 2 subunits (BCCP1 and BCCP2) of chloroplastic, heterodimeric ACCase, involved in fatty acid metabolism (Aubert et al., 1996 ; Che, 2003 ; Li et al., 2012 ). BCCP2 is primarily expressed in flowers and developing seeds, but scarcely detectable in seedling tissues (Thelen et al., 2001 ). We used a similar Western blot analysis to determine whether cadaverine treatment is sufficient to induce differences in MCAA and/or BCCP proteins biotinylation in dissected root and/or shoot tissues. Wild‐type, cdh3 , and cdh3 [ BIO3‐BIO1pro :: BIO3‐BIO1 ] # 2 rescue seedlings were germinated and grown on control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Roots and shoots were then dissected. Proteins extracted from these samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using a streptavidin probe. The amounts of biotinylated MCCA protein showed little change upon cadaverine treatment in the root (Figure 5a,c ) or shoot (Figure 5b,d ). On the other hand, a decrease in biotinylated BCCP1 protein was observed in both roots (Figure 5a,e ) and shoots (Figure 5b,f ), with a larger magnitude of decrease occurring in the roots. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Levels of biotinylated proteins are altered following cadaverine (Cad) treatment. (a,b) Seed were germinated on control or cadaverine‐containing media. Following 8 days of treatment, roots (a) and shoots (b) were dissected and protein was extracted. 150 µg of protein were loaded on to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. After electro‐transfer on to a PVDF membrane, biotinylated proteins were detected with Licor IRDye CW800‐labeled streptavidin or anti‐biotin carboxyl carrier protein (anti‐BCCP) 1 and 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA carboxylase (MCCA) antibodies. In all cases, anti‐RPT4A antibodies were used to control for loading differences between samples. Blots shown in (a,b) are representative of three biological replicates showing similar results. Quantifications of band intensities from these blots are summarized in (c–f) for all three biological replicates. (c–f) Protein amount and biotinylation were quantified based on band intensity, standardized to the RPT4A signals, and then standardized again to Columbia‐0 (Col‐0). Expression results shown in the graphs represent three biological replicates, with a circle or square indicating the value of each control or cadaverine replicate, respectively. Bars indicate standard error. *Student's t ‐test P < 0.05. ** P < 0.01, compared with Col‐0 control treatment. (c) MCCA total protein and MCCA biotinylation in roots. (d) MCCA total protein and biotinylation in shoots. (e) BCCP1 total protein and BCCP1 biotinylation in roots. (f) BCCP1 total protein and BCCP1 biotinylation in shoots. Cadaverine‐induced changes in biotinylated protein abundance could be due to decreased levels of target protein biotinylation, and/or relate to changes in abundance of the corresponding proteins. To investigate these possibilities, we used MCCA‐ and BCCP1‐specific antibodies to analyze the abundance of these proteins in control and cadaverine‐treated seedlings. Results shown in Figure 5c demonstrated increased MCCA levels in the root upon cadaverine treatment only in cdh3 , while no significant changes were observed in the shoot (Figure 5d ). BCCP1 protein abundance in cadaverine‐treated samples relative to controls, showed no significant changes in the root or shoot (Figure 5e,f ). qRT‐PCR analysis of MCCA and BCCP1 expression showed no significant transcriptional alteration in cdh3 and Col‐0 upon cadaverine treatment, whether applied since germination, or for 24, 48, or 72 h (Figure S4 ). Taken together, our data are consistent with cadaverine treatment leading to decreased biotin synthesis, thereby resulting in decreased biotinylation in BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots. They are also consistent with decreased biotinylation levels of MCCA protein in cdh3 mutant roots, as increased MCCA apoprotein abundance is not accompanied by increased levels of biotinylated MCCA (Figure 5c ). In summary, cadaverine treatment significantly affects the amount of biotinylated BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots. Lipid composition is altered by cadaverine ACCase requires biotinylation of the BCCP1 subunit to generate malonyl‐CoA from acetyl‐CoA at the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis. The cadaverine‐induced reduction in biotinylated BCCP1 protein in plant tissues is expected to decrease fatty acid production. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact of cadaverine treatment on the lipid profile of Arabidopsis seedlings. Wild‐type Col‐0 seeds were germinated and grown on control media for 5 days, then transferred to either control media or media containing 200 µ m cadaverine, and allowed to grow for 72 more hours, a time previously determined to be sufficient to allow primary root growth inhibition by cadaverine (Figure 1 ). At that time, lipids were extracted from these samples, and subjected to lipidomics analyses by tandem mass spectrometry (Shiva et al., 2013 ). Total polar lipids as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids, were analyzed with five biological replicates. The results showed that total TAG decreased in abundance upon cadaverine treatment, with six of 31 TAG species showing significant decreases (Figure 6 ), all of which were TAGs having 18:3 acyls. On the other hand, TAGs containing short‐chain fatty acids, 16:0 and 16:1, had little changes with the treatment (Figure 6 ). The reduced TAG synthesis along with the higher percentage of short‐chain fatty acid compositions in TAGs were also previously observed in Arabidopsis plants with limited biotin availability (Pommerrenig et al., 2012 ). Therefore, these results are consistent with the negative effect of cadaverine on biotin availability and TAG production. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Triacylglycerol content following 72 h of cadaverine (Cad) treatment. Columbia‐0 seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to either control or 200 μ m cadaverine‐containing media after 5 days. 72 h post‐treatment, whole seedlings were harvested and used for lipid extraction and analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. The average of five biological replicates are shown containing approximately 200 seedlings per replicate, with dots representing each replicate. Bars indicate standard error. Student’s t ‐test was done to determine significance between cadaverine treatment and control. * P < 0.05. ** P < 0.01. We observed similar levels of total polar lipid species between cadaverine‐treated and control seedlings, with slight decreases observed in total PA and phosphatidylinositol (PI), and an increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Table S1 ). Although total DAG levels were not altered by cadaverine treatment, specific DAGs changed in abundance in response to cadaverine, including increases in DAG 16:0/16:1, DAG 18:0/16:2 and DAG 18:3/dnOPDA, and decreases in DAG 18:3/18:3 content (Table S1 ). In addition, we have also seen modification of phospholipids, albeit below the significance threshold, with PI and PA decreasing with cadaverine treatment.",
    "Conclusion": "We have shown that cadaverine functions to inhibit primary root growth by modulating biotin synthesis through inhibition of the BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme. Cadaverine response can be chemically rescued with biotin, DAPA, but not KAPA. While KAPA could potentially be excluded from transport into seedlings, the results of our in vitro reaction show cadaverine to inhibit BIO3‐BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine did not alter the expression of BIO3‐BIO1 at the protein level in wild‐type or cdh3, and overexpression of BIO3‐BIO1 from our cdh3 rescue line resulted in increased BIO3‐BIO1 protein and resistance to cadaverine, in agreement with an effect on BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic function. Analysis of the BIO3‐BIO1 mutant, cdh3 , reported here shows biotin deficiency results in decreased primary root growth, which is similar to the phenotype observed in the hypomorphic mutation in BIO4 (Li et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, analysis of cdh3 root growth on cadaverine‐containing media also shows evidence of cell death in the elongation zone upon staining with propidium iodide (Figure 1c ). Evidence of cell death was also reported in shoots of a hypomorphic mutant of BIO4 (Li et al., 2012 ), indicating that decreases in biotin cause cell death in both roots and shoots. The localization of cell death to the elongation zone of cadaverine‐treated cdh3 may reflect an increased requirement for biotin in tissues that undergo rapid cell growth and expansion. Alternatively, deficiencies in fatty acid synthesis have been shown to result in an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria, along with cell death (Wu et al., 2015 ). The similar phenotypes observed in cadaverine‐treated cdh3 mutant seedlings (this study) and biotin‐deficient mutants (Li et al., 2012 ; Wu et al., 2015 ) thus suggest that a deficiency in biotin synthesis may underlie the developmental impact of cadaverine. Inhibition of biotin synthesis has long been a target for herbicides and antibiotics. While numerous compounds have been identified to inhibit biotin biosynthesis, to date only one natural product, amiclenomycin, had been identified to inhibit DAPA synthase in bacteria, through formation of a covalent adduct with PLP (Sandmark et al., 2002 ). Our results indicate cadaverine is a natural DAPA synthase inhibitor in Arabidopsis. Cadaverine may function to inhibit BIO3‐BIO1 through formation of a Schiff base with PLP, as observed with amiclenomycin, or through direct interaction with the binding site. BIO3‐BIO1 inhibition by cadaverine cannot be mimicked by treatments with putrescine and/or putrescine‐derived polyamines. The different inhibitory activities displayed by distinct polyamines may be determined by charge distribution of the amine groups or subcellular compartmentalization. Given the proximity of A662 to PLP, the hypersensitive response of cdh3 mutant to cadaverine could be explained by an altered conformation of the mutant protein resulting in decreased reaction efficiency. However, multiple attempts at producing recombinant cdh3 mutant enzyme failed, preventing us from directly testing this hypothesis. Future work will be aimed at characterizing cadaverine’s inhibitory effect on DAPA synthase activity in plants. As we have shown exogenous biotin rescues the cadaverine response phenotype, the effect of cadaverine treatment on primary root growth is in part associated with induced alterations in lipid composition, including decreased TAG content, and/or signaling phospholipids. Analysis of SUC5, required for biotin transport into the developing embryo from the maternal plant, shows the suc5 and bio1 or bio2 double mutants rescued with exogenous biotin have an increased proportion of short chain fatty acids (16:0 and 16:1), in accordance with our observation of cadaverine treatment (Figure 6 ; Table S1 ) (Pommerrenig et al., 2012 ). The decrease in PI and PA could be due to increased activity through the phosphoinositide pathway to generate DAG to compensate for decreases in TAG. Alternatively, cadaverine may function to affect the components of the phosphoinositide pathway, independently from its effect on biotin, contributing to the root growth phenotype we see in response to cadaverine. Biotin is also involved in amino acid homeostasis, gluconeogenesis, and other aspects of central metabolism. MCCase has previously been shown to accumulate in response to biotin depletion or starvation to allow for recycling of amino acids (Aubert et al., 1996 ; Che, 2003 ; Ding et al., 2012 ). The increase of MCCA apoprotein in cdh3 (Figure 5a,c ) is compatible with a mechanism that allows modulation of target MCCA protein abundance by biotin availability, in agreement with previous studies (Che, 2003 ; Li et al., 2012 ). The absence of such changes in cadaverine‐treated wild‐type plants may simply reflect a lower level of biotin limitation in wild‐type roots. While root growth inhibition of cdh3 was not observed with putrescine‐derived polyamines (Figure 1g ), the pao4 phenotype and subsequent rescue by biotin (Figure 3d ) suggests a connection between cadaverine and the putrescine‐derived polyamines. Polyamine oxidases, such as PAO4, oxidize polyamines spermidine and spermine, thereby contributing to putrescine‐derived polyamines homeostasis (Kamada‐Nobusada et al., 2008 ; Liu et al., 2014 ). pao4 mutants show increased spermine content, decreased spermidine and hydrogen peroxide, and changes in primary metabolism (Sequera‐Mutiozabal et al., 2016 ). Altered primary metabolism associated with the pao4 mutation may reflect an indirect role for the putrescine‐derived polyamines or their catabolic products in biotin synthesis or the downstream effects of biotin. The putrescine‐derived polyamines are essential components for growth and development; for example, thermospermine is required for vasculature development in Arabidopsis (Kakehi et al., 2008 ) and spermidine is required for eukaryotic translation (Park et al., 1982 ). Studies on the functions of putrescine‐derived polyamines have been hampered by the embryo lethality associated with spermidine depletion (Imai et al., 2004 ). Therefore, it is possible that putrescine‐derived polyamines provide other essential roles that have yet to be uncovered. OCT1 has been characterized as a carnitine transporter and was proposed to transport cations, such as polyamines (Lelandais‐Brière et al., 2007 ; Strohm et al., 2015 ). In mammals the carnitine cycle allows acyl transport into the mitochondria for beta‐oxidation. An analogous mechanism has been proposed in plants after identification of a carnitine acyl carrier‐like protein with homology to mammalian carnitine acyl carrier, but the role of carnitine in plants has yet to be further elucidated (Lawand et al., 2002 ). oct1 mutants could be sensitive to cadaverine because of altered polyamines homeostasis and/or localization. Alternatively, cadaverine‐induced lipid deficiency could be exacerbated by altered acyl transport capabilities in the oct1 mutants. In some plants, cadaverine abundance has been found to increase in response to environmental stress, a process that is believed to contribute to stress mitigation. Furthermore, microbes from the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, or endosphere have also been shown to provide plants with cadaverine, as does decomposing matter in proximity of a root system (Cassán, 2009 ). Both endogenous and exogenously applied cadaverine can modulate plant growth and environment‐related stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016 ). We present here that cadaverine inhibits biotin biosynthesis and primary metabolism in Arabidopsis through direct inhibition of DAPA synthase, thereby reducing the accumulation of TAGs. If the physiological responses to cadaverine are adaptive, the presence of cadaverine, either through association with microbes (in most plants including A. thaliana ) or through stress‐induced synthesis, where observed, may serve to divert a plant’s resources from growth to defense responses. Future investigations addressing the conservation of cadaverine‐response pathways in plants, and the development of methods aimed at better controlling the effects of cadaverine on biotin synthesis, its impact on primary metabolism within the biomass, and on root‐system architecture, should yield important new insights, facilitating the development of new crop varieties with improved productivity, enhanced energy content of the biomass, and increased adaptability to the stresses associated with climate change or growth on marginal lands.",
