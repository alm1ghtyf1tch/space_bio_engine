    "Abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel ...",
    "Results": "Twelve significant genes were identified by MR analysis of druggable genes We employed the IVW method as the primary analytical approach. Sixteen druggable genes exhibited a strong association with the development of CKD at a FDR of less than 0.05. These genes are PTPN22, KSR1, MAP2K5, CASP9, C4A, S100B, MYLK4, CHSY1, TUBB, C4B, XYLT1, DHFR, GUCY1B2, CXCR1, CD96, and VAMP8. To assess the pleiotropy of these 16 significant genes, we utilized MR-Egger regression. The intercept p-value for “S100B” was less than 0.05, indicating the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. Conversely, the intercept p-values for the remaining 15 significant genes were greater than 0.05, suggesting no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy for these genes. The potential heterogeneity of IVs was assessed using Cochrane’s Q-test. The results indicated significant heterogeneity for the IVs associated with “C4A,” “C4B,” and “XYLT1,” while no evidence of heterogeneity was found for the other significant genes. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we did not accept the presence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Consequently, we concluded that a causal association exists between 12 genes—PTPN22, KSR1, MAP2K5, CASP9, MYLK4, CHSY1, TUBB, DHFR, GUCY1B2, CXCR1, CD96, and VAMP8—and CKD (Fig. 3 ). It is worth mentioning that the MR-PRESSO test revealed no evidence of pleiotropy among these 12 significant genes. Fig. 3. Open in a new tab The 12 druggable genes are closely related to the risk of CKD after FDR correction. If OR is greater than 1, the gene is considered to be positively correlated with the occurrence of CKD, and if it is less than 1, it is considered to be negatively correlated. FDR is the corrected p-value, and FDR is greater than 0.05, which is considered statistically significant. Among these 12 significant genes, TUBB (OR: 1.2352; 95% CI: 1.1305–1.3496; FDR = 0.0085), PTPN22 (OR: 1.2897; 95% CI: 1.1893–1.3985; FDR < 0.001), MAP2K5 (OR: 1.1055; 95% CI: 1.0679–1.1445; FDR < 0.001), CHSY1 (OR: 1.1152; 95% CI: 1.0667–1.1659; FDR = 0.0044), DHFR (OR: 1.0390; 95% CI: 1.0214–1.0570; FDR = 0.0347), CXCR1 (OR: 1.1188; 95% CI: 1.0634–1.1771; FDR = 0.0430) and CD96 (OR: 1.0945; 95% CI: 1.0505–1.1404; FDR = 0.0475) expression were positively correlated with the risk of CKD. KSR1 (OR: 0.8809; 95% CI: 0.8441–0.9192; FDR < 0.001), CASP9 (OR: 0.8782; 95% CI: 0.8389–0.9195; FDR < 0.001), MYLK4 (OR: 0.9078; 95% CI: 0.8744–0.9423; FDR = 0.0011), GUCY1B2 (OR: 0.9068; 95% CI: 0.8679–0.9475; FDR = 0.0359) and VAMP8 (OR: 0.9215; 95% CI: 0.8879–0.9565; FDR = 0.0489) expression were negatively associated with CKD risk. (Information on the IVs used for these significant genes is detailed in Supplementary Material Table S2, and the results of MR analyses are detailed in Supplementary Material Table S3) Colocalization analysis of 12 significant genes Colocalization analysis can provide additional evidence for Mendelian randomization analysis, suggesting that associations between instrumental variables used for analysis and outcomes may be causal. Colocalization supports both an association between genetic variation and exposure and an association between exposure and outcome. When colocalization analyses show positive results, specific genetic variants share the same genetic location as signals associated with both exposure and outcome, this strengthens the belief that the association is due to genetic variants directly affecting exposure, and thus outcome. In addition, it reduces the likelihood of pleiotropy to some extent. In order to strengthen the evidence for an association between these key genes and CKD. For the 12 genes, we performed colocalization analyses to estimate the likelihood that the cis-eQTL and CKD results share a causal variant. The result of colocalization analysis indicated that CKD and TUBB genes might share a causal variant, with PP.H4 exceeding 0.80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Consequently, based on MR and colocalization analyses, we infer that TUBB is statistically likely to be a potential drug target for CKD treatment. (For details of the results of significant gene colocalization analysis, see Table S4 in the Supplementary Material) Demonstrate information about key genes on the corresponding chromosome The position of a gene on a chromosome may be related to its function, expression regulation, and interactions with other genes. By analyzing the chromosomal location of genes, we can obtain clues about their potential involvement in specific biological processes or pathways. Besides, many genetic disorders are associated with abnormalities in specific genes or gene clusters on chromosomes. Knowing the chromosomal location of these genes helps identify genetic variations related to diseases, providing important information for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Moreover, chromosomes are carriers of genetic information, and their structure, organization, and evolution are crucial for understanding the functional and evolutionary history of an organism’s genome. By analyzing the chromosomal location of genes, we can obtain clues about genome structure, chromosomal rearrangements, and evolutionary events. So, we show the information of the starting position of the remarkable genes on specific chromosomes. For example, the TUBB gene is located on chromosome 6 in the segment 30,687,978–30,693,203, and the PTPN22 gene is located on chromosome 1 in the segment 114,356,433–1,144,414,381 (Fig. 4 ). (Seeing Supplementary Material Table S1 for details). Fig. 4. Open in a new tab This figure shows the relationship between significant genes and chromosome positions. For example, TUBB is located on chromosome 6. Analysis of specific biological processes, functional classes and signalling pathways corresponding to key genes by GO/KEGG enrichment GO enrichment analysis showed that in the Biological Process module, these genes were mainly enriched on regulation of MAP kinase activity and regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity. In the Cellular Component module, these genes were mainly enriched in primary lysosome. In the molecular Function Module, these genes were mainly enriched on protein serine kinase activity (Fig. 5 ). KEGG pathway analyses showed that these genes were mainly enriched on Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway (Fig. 6 ). (For details of the results of GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, please refer to Table S5 and Table S6 in the Supplementary Material.) Fig. 5. Open in a new tab This figure shows the results of GO enrichment analysis of 12 significant genes. For example, in the Biological Process module, there are three significant genes enriched in the regulation of MAP kinase activity. Fig. 6. Open in a new tab This figure shows the results of KEGG enrichment analysis of 12 significant genes. For example, there are two significant genes enriched in Gap junction. Notably, TUBB was pathway linked to Cellular community - eukaryotes, Infectious disease/bacterial, and Cellular Processes. In GO enrichment analysis, TUBB was associated with natural killer cell mediated immunity, leukocyte mediated immunity, lymphocyte mediated immunity, primary lysosome, azurophil granule, nuclear envelope lumen, spindle, intercellular bridge, GTPase activating protein binding, MHC class I protein binding, and MHC protein binding and other related.",
    "Conclusion": "In this study, we found that the expression of 12 genes was closely related to CKD. For genes demonstrating significant associations in the MR analysis, we performed a comprehensive suite of sensitivity analyses and functional assessments. These included Cochrane’s Q-test, MR-Egger regression, colocalization analysis, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the expression of the TUBB gene and CKD. MR analysis of druggable genes, along with colocalization analysis, has yielded compelling evidence suggesting that TUBB is a potential therapeutic target for CKD. The TUBB gene encodes β-tubulin, a structural component of microtubules that binds to α-tubulin to form a heterodimer, which subsequently contributes to microtubule assembly 26 . Microtubules (MTs) have been characterized as long, hollow polymers with a diameter of 25 nm and lengths ranging from less than 1 μm to over 100 μm. They were initially described as consisting of approximately 13 linear protofilaments, forming a polymer with a fast-growing positive end (exposed β-tubulin) and a slow-growing negative end (exposed α-tubulin) 27 . MTs are integral to the formation of cellular structures and the regulation of cellular functions, such as cell polarity and morphology, chromosome segregation during cell division, and the localization and transport of organelles 28 . Furthermore, MTs facilitate intracellular transport, assemble into larger structures with the aid of auxiliary proteins, and interact with various cell types to establish mature networks 27 . It has been proposed that microtubule-targeting compounds inhibit microtubule polymerization, thereby causing an imbalance in microtubule dynamics. This disruption results in spindle apparatus damage, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately, tumor cell death 29 . Consequently, compounds that target microtubules are capable of inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It is apparent that these compounds can interfere with a range of critical cellular processes 30 . Among the proteins constituting microtubules, β-tubulin is particularly significant. During microtubule polymerization, only the β-tubulin subunit is capable of hydrolyzing GTP following the incorporation of microtubule dimers 31 . This underscores the critical role of TUBB and its encoded β-tubulin proteins in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and human immunity. Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) developed based on β-tubulin proteins have a longstanding history and are considered among the earliest anti-cancer drugs 30 . For instance, compounds such as vincristine, vinblastine, and vindesine target the Vinca domain located at the inter-dimer interface between two longitudinally aligned tubulin dimers within the β-tubulin monomer 32 – 34 . Additionally, colchicine, benzimidazoles, and combretastatins interact with the colchicine binding sites situated in the deep pocket between αβ-tubulin dimers within β-tubulin monomers 35 . Furthermore, binding to the Taxane site of β-tubulin monomers in the inner lumen of MTs stabilizes the MT lattice. Consequently, MT-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and epoxomicin have been developed 36 . Secondly, Maytansine and Spongistatin interact near the Vinca site on the exposed pocket of β-tubulin 37 , 38 . Similarly, the compounds Laulimalide and Peloruside target β-tubulin protein pockets oriented towards the exterior of microtubules (MTs) 39 , 40 . In 2021, the Gatorbulin site was identified, located within the α-tubulin subunit, between α- and β-tubulin, and proximal to the colchicine site. This site functions to form a wedge between two longitudinally aligned MT dimers at the MT terminus 41 . Recently, a novel compound named Cevipabulin has been reported to bind to this pocket 42 . The numerous sites of targeted drug development, whether currently known or unknown, associated with TUBB present substantial opportunities for TUBB to be considered a potential drug target in CKD. As discussed above, TUBB gene expression produces β - tubulin, which is involved in the composition of microtubules. Meanwhile, microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) interact with microtubules, such as participating in microtubule binding, regulating microtubule stability, polymerization, and depolymerization processes. They interact with each other and jointly participate in maintaining the cytoskeleton structure and cell morphology within the cell 24 . This is similar to our GO/KEGG enrichment analysis results, where in the Biological process module, these genes are mainly enriched in the regulation of MAP kinase activity. The relationship between GTPase activating protein (GAP) and microtubule proteins is close, and the microtubule network formed by the β - microtubule protein encoded by the TUBB gene can serve as a transport track and localization platform for signaling molecules 28 . This is similar to the results of our KEGG enrichment analysis, which mainly concentrates on the Gap junction. These β-tubulin protein-based microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) play a crucial role in tumor treatment by disrupting microtubule homeostasis within the spindle apparatus, thereby activating mitotic checkpoints. This disruption arrests cells at the mid-stage of mitosis, ultimately leading to cell death through apoptosis 43 , 44 . Additionally, these agents have demonstrated efficacy against parasites 45 . Recent research has indicated that TUBB, a microtubule protein, may play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying various renal diseases, including tubulointerstitial disease and renal fibrosis. For instance, Sang et al. demonstrated that the inhibition of microtubule dynamics hinders the repair of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and promotes renal fibrosis 46 . Additionally, Yang et al. identified β-tubulin as a serum marker for renal clear cell carcinoma, noting that this type of carcinoma is associated with elevated TUBB expression 47 . Although there is a paucity of comprehensive studies specifically addressing the relationship between TUBB and CKD, emerging research has increasingly concentrated on the interplay between MTs and their associated proteins in the context of CKD. A cross-sectional study has identified β-tubulin as a potential biomarker for cognitive impairment in CKD patients 48 . Additionally, recent findings indicate that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) mini-nuclear host gene 12 exacerbates inflammation and apoptosis while inhibiting autophagy in acute kidney injury by upregulating TUBB expression 49 . This finding aligns with the results of our analysis, which demonstrated a positive association between TUBB expression and CKD risk. Consequently, we propose that TUBB represents a potential therapeutic target for CKD, meriting further in-depth investigation into its underlying mechanisms. Apart from TUBB, several other potential targets were identified (Fig. 3 ). Although these additional significant genes were not corroborated by colocalization analysis, the important value of them cannot be entirely dismissed, and they continue to present a broad spectrum of possibilities for CKD drug development. Despite our rigorous analytical approach, which included the exclusion of results exhibiting heterogeneity and pleiotropy (including horizontal pleiotropy), our study has certain limitations. Firstly, our findings are based on statistical extrapolation, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios where other confounding factors may interfere. Consequently, our results cannot entirely substitute for basic or clinical trials, nor can they guarantee the actual efficacy of the drug. Therefore, further basic and clinical research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms and effects of TUBB on CKD. Besides, the current analysis is ethnically constrained, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Importantly, our study offers significant insights and guidance for advancing research on identifying drug targets for CKD.",
