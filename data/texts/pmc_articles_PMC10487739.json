    "Abstract": "Abstract The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. Keywords: spaceflight, brain, digital spatial profiling, gene expression, regional difference",
    "Results": "2.1. Gene Expression Profiling of CA, DG, CT, and FCT Samples Subjected to Spaceflight We performed in situ RNA assays in the brains of mice subjected to spaceflight (FLT), as well as grounded controls (GC), using DSP. Half of the mice were treated with BuOE, while the other half were treated with saline (SAL). Four regions within the brain of each mouse were assayed: the CA, DG, CT, and FCT ( Figure 1 A). All samples achieved high sequencing saturation ( Supplementary File S1: Figure S1A ), and Q3 normalization was performed on the data ( Supplementary File S1: Figure S1B ) for all downstream analyses. Normalized count values of gene expression were highly correlated across replicates of the four samples ( Supplementary File S1: Figure S1C–F ). A principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that spaceflight had an effect on all four regions in SAL control animals, with CA and DG being impacted the most ( Figure 1 B). Figure 1.

( B ) Principal components analysis of the SAL transcriptomic data from the indicated brain regions. Filled circles represent the GC data, while empty circles represent the FLT data. We next performed a differential expression analysis (FLT versus GC) on the SAL data from each brain region and identified a total of 408 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CA, 271 in DG, 189 in FCT, and 150 in CT ( Figure 2 A–D). Each brain region largely had a unique set of DEGs, though a small number of DEGs were common to two or more regions ( Figure 2 E). Figure 2.

The top five DEGs by magnitude of fold change are as follows: Ptgds , Cpne7 , Cdkn2d , Msrb1 , and Bsph1 for CA ( Figure 3 A and Supplementary File S1: Figure S2A ), Sst , Crygc , Psrc1 , Abtb2 , and Kcna4 for DG ( Figure 3 B and Supplementary File S1: Figure S2B ), Arc , Ptgds , Col6a1 , Tshz2 , and Dmrt2 for FCT ( Figure 3 C and Supplementary File S1: Figure S2C ), and Arc , Ptgds , Mobp , Gm9936 , and Apod for CT ( Figure 3 D and Supplementary File S1: Figure S2D ). Many of these top-changing genes play important roles in apoptosis, cell cycle, neuroinflammation, neurotransmission, myelination, and mitochondrial and metabolic stress response. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Top spaceflight DEGs. ( A – D ), Barplots showing the normalized expression values of the top 5 DEGs (FLT-SAL versus GC-SAL) by magnitude of log 2 fold change. In order to determine whether spaceflight might accelerate certain disease processes in the brain, we compared the FLT-SAL vs. GC-SAL DEGs to curated lists of gene-disease associations. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was the most frequent disease associated with the DEGs, and each brain region had at least one DEG with a known association with AD; in all, 22 of the GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL DEGs have a known association with a neurological disease ( Supplementary File S2 ). This raises the possibility that spaceflight stress may increase the risk of onset and/or progression of certain neurological disorders, such as AD. Next, we performed a pathway analysis of the GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL DEGs from each region independently. Importantly, each of the four brain regions had at least one pathway known to be affected by oxidative stress that was significantly enriched: VEGF signaling pathway in CA ( Figure 4 A), Calcium signaling pathway in DG ( Figure 4 B), FoxO signaling pathway in FCT ( Figure 4 C), and ECM-receptor interaction in CT ( Figure 4 D). In addition, a number of metabolic pathways were also significantly enriched, such as pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in CA, cAMP signaling pathway in DG, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis in FCT, and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in CT.

BuOE Attenuates Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Changes in the CA, DG, FCT, and CT Finally, given that we observed a robust transcriptional response to spaceflight, we sought to determine if treatment with BuOE would attenuate these changes. A PCA of global transcription shows that in all brain regions examined except FCT, BuOE during spaceflight brought transcription levels closer to GC animals ( Figure 5 A and Supplementary File S1: Figure S3A ), suggesting a partial attenuation of spaceflight transcriptional alterations by BuOE. Even for FCT, the distance between FLT-BuOE and GC-BuOE was smaller than the distance between FLT-SAL and GC-SAL, again suggesting BuOE results in a reduced transcriptional response due to spaceflight. We obtained BuOE-induced DEGs (FLT-SAL vs. FLT-BuOE) using the same criteria as for the spaceflight-induced DEGs (GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL). We expected that if BuOE attenuates spaceflight-induced differential expression, then BuOE-induced DEGs should tend to change in the opposite direction as the spaceflight-induced DEGs. Indeed, for all brain regions, significantly more spaceflight-induced DEGs changed in the opposite direction as BuOE-induced DEGs ( Figure 5 B–E). We also performed a permutation test (see Section 4 ) in which genes were shuffled in order to randomly select up- and down-regulated BuOE-induced DEGs, and checked the overlaps with the spaceflight-induced DEGs. For all brain regions, the number of random overlaps after 1000 permutations was never as large as the number of actual overlaps in the opposite direction ( Supplementary File S1: Figure S3B–E ). Figure 5. Open in a new tab BuOE attenuates spaceflight-induced gene expression changes. ( A ), Principal components analysis of the indicated regions and treatment conditions. Each gene was averaged across replicates to obtain the PCA. Individual replicates are shown in the PCA in Supplementary File S1: Figure S3A . ( B – E ), Barplots comparing the number of spaceflight-induced DEGs (GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL) that change in the opposite versus the same direction (dir) as BuOE-induced DEGs (FLT-SAL vs. FLT-BuOE). p -values were calculated by Fisher’s Exact test. *** p < 10 −5 ; **** p < 10 −10 . At many of the spaceflight-induced DEGs, the direction of change in expression by BuOE during spaceflight, regardless of significance, tended to be in the opposite direction, and in many cases these changes were not induced by BuOE in GC mice ( Supplementary File S1: Figure S4A ), again suggesting a partial attenuation of spaceflight-induced transcriptional changes in the brain by BuOE. Of note, such an attenuation was observed for several genes in the significantly enriched pathways responsive to oxidative stress; e.g., VEGF signaling pathway in CA ( Figure 6 A), Calcium signaling pathway in DG ( Figure 6 B), FoxO signaling pathway in FCT ( Figure 6 C), and ECM-receptor interaction in CT ( Figure 6 D). Similarly, BuOE also attenuated spaceflight-induced changes in the expression of several genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease ( Supplementary File S1: Figure S4B–E ). Figure 6.

    "Conclusion": "In this study, we performed a differential expression analysis of spaceflight versus GC mice and identified 944 genes that were significantly altered by spaceflight in at least one of the four brain regions examined. Our results revealed common and region-specific gene expression changes in the brain due to spaceflight, with the most robust changes observed in the hippocampal CA 1 and DG regions, suggesting that these regions may be particularly vulnerable to spaceflight. The hippocampus is not only the center for learning and memory, it is a site for neurogenesis as well [ 33 ]. Numerous cell types in the hippocampus contribute to generating neurons important for encoding new memories, spatial learning, and cognitive flexibility [ 34 ]. Space radiation may damage hippocampal cells [ 35 ] and thus potentially suppress neurogenesis, leading to memory decline, anxiety, and depression [ 34 ]. Hippocampal neuronal circuitry also modulates and affects physiology and functional connectivity with more distant brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex [ 36 , 37 , 38 ]. In order to determine whether spaceflight might accelerate certain disease processes in the brain, we looked for known associations with neurological disease amidst the spaceflight-induced DEGs. Several of the DEGs have known associations with Alzheimer’s disease, as well as other neurological diseases. Previous studies have shown that space radiation contributes to amyloid pathologies, neuroinflammation, and cognitive function impairments resembling age-associated cognitive decline in animals [ 4 , 39 , 40 ]. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that space stressors could induce or accelerate neurodegenerative processes. To obtain insights into the biological processes being affected in the brain by spaceflight, we performed pathway analyses on the spaceflight-induced DEGs. Interestingly, several pathways known to be altered by oxidative stress were significantly enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight: VEGF signaling [ 41 ] in CA, calcium signaling [ 42 ] in DG, FoxO signaling [ 43 ] in FCT, and ECM-receptor interaction [ 44 ] in CT. In addition, a number of metabolic pathways were among the most significantly enriched, consistent with numerous studies that have found alterations in metabolism and its regulation due to spaceflight-induced neuroendocrine and psychophysiological changes [ 45 ]. For example, a mouse study revealed an accumulation of lipids in the liver after spaceflight [ 46 ]. Studies also show that space stressors induce metabolic changes in mouse plasma and in the expression of metabolism-related genes [ 47 ]. Longitudinal metabolomic profiles revealed sex-specific perturbations in glucose and amino acid metabolism that result from the stressors of long-duration spaceflight [ 48 ]; therefore, follow-up studies on sexually dimorphic transcriptional responses to spaceflight in the brain may be warranted. The Circadian Entrainment pathway was significantly altered by spaceflight in DG. This is consistent with our previous spaceflight genomic study [ 49 ], which showed spaceflight altered some genes associated with circadian rhythm in the mouse retina. Spaceflight missions often expose astronauts to atypical sleep–wake cycles and work schedules [ 50 , 51 ]. Changes in circadian rhythm may have a significant impact on neurobehavior and neurophysiological processes [ 52 ]. Previous studies have found that circadian rhythm disruption or circadian misalignment in astronauts may affect performance and cognitive function [ 53 , 54 , 55 ]. Our results suggest that changes in circadian rhythm induced by spaceflight may involve the DG region. This could help in developing countermeasures for sleep disturbance during spaceflight. Our findings will help to improve the understanding of regional variation or sensitivities in susceptibility to brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases that exist during spaceflight. In addition, our findings may provide novel insight into cellular mechanisms and operational risks that underlie the effects of spaceflight-mediated structural and functional damage to different brain regions. In future studies, the regulatory mechanism for regional differences in stress response should be further explored in terms of variations of cell types, vasculature, neurotransmitter profiles, hemodynamics, and metabolism. Studies have shown a spaceflight-induced increase in the production of lipid peroxidation products and a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity [ 26 ]. It has been suggested that in stressful environments, antioxidant expression of SOD and catalase are reduced to conserve energy [ 56 ]. BuOE, a recently developed antioxidant compound, is among the most highly potent metalloporphyrins that have been evaluated for safety and efficacy [ 57 ]. Many animal studies have demonstrated that BuOE is highly effective in mitigating oxidative stress induced by radiation exposure [ 58 ]. We therefore treated a subset of our mice with BuOE in order to test its ability to attenuate spaceflight-induced changes in transcription in the CA, DG, FCT, and CT. Treatment with BuOE reversed spaceflight-induced changes in transcription of a substantial number of DEGs, and a statistically significant number of spaceflight-induced DEGs changed in the opposite direction as did BuOE-induced DEGs, suggesting that BuOE may be effective in attenuating at least some of the effects of spaceflight stress on the brain. We presented evidence that BuOE may attenuate the consequences of oxidative stress on the brain during spaceflight. BuOE attenuated spaceflight-induced changes in the expression of a number of genes in the oxidative stress–responsive pathways that were enriched due to spaceflight. We note that BuOE had a particularly strong effect in reversing spaceflight-induced changes of the following genes in oxidative stress–responsive pathways ( Figure 6 ): Prkca in the CA, Atp2b4 in the DG, Homer1 in the FCT, and Itga7 in the CT. Since we had identified known associations between spaceflight-induced DEGs and neurological diseases, we speculated whether BuOE attenuated the effects of these genes as well. Indeed, we found that BuOE reversed spaceflight-induced changes in the expression of several genes with known associations to Alzheimer’s disease. Our results suggest that BuOE affects each brain region in a distinct way. The PCA ( Figure 5 A) suggests that the region with the greatest degree of attenuation by BuOE was the CT, in that treatment with BuOE brings the spaceflight transcriptomic profile closest to that of grounded controls in CT. On the other hand, BuOE treatment actually moved the spaceflight transcriptomic profile further away from grounded control animals in FCT, suggesting that FCT may be the region with the most resistance to superoxide scavengers. The DG and CA had intermediate responses to BuOE relative to the CT and FCT. Taken together, our results on BuOE warrant further study as a potential therapeutic candidate for CNS protection against brain injury and neurodegeneration induced by ionizing radiation and environmental stress.",
