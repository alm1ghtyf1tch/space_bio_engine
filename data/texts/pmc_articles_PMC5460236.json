    "Abstract": "NASA’s Space Biology and Human Research Program entities have recently spearheaded communications both internally and externally to coordinate the agency’s translational research efforts. In this paper, we strongly advocate for translational ...",
    "Results": "Evidence for increased microbial virulence has recently been collected and reported from both spaceflight-analog systems and actual spaceflight. 61 , 65 , 66 Although the conduct of virulence studies during spaceflight is challenging and often impractical in humans, data are being collected as part of the ISS Microbial Observatory, 62 recent astronaut and rodent microbiome studies, 67 – 69 and the edible plant studies (e.g., Veggie). 70 , 71 When available, these results can improve our understanding of the astronaut-microbe interaction and of the potential health risks to the astronaut.",
