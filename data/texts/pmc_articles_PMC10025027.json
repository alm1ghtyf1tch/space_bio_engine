    "Results": "3.1. Germination parameters in salinity stress conditions Salt stress had a major influence on seed germination in the absence of priming treatment. Significantly lower seed germination metrics were observed in the salt-stressed non-primed cauliflower seeds (NPS) than in the non-stressed non-primed (NPN) seeds. A decline in germination potential (29.17%), germination rate (30.72%), germination index (42.88%), vigour index (70.59%), shoot length (33.9%), root length (68.64%), shoot fresh weight (43.01%), root fresh weight (50.3%), shoot dry weight (46.75%), and root dry weight (51.0%) was observed in NPS compared to NPN ( Table 1 ).

Effect of different seed priming treatments on germination metrics under salinity stress The germination attributes varied with different priming treatments, viz. hydropriming, halopriming, etc. under salinity stress in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2 ). All the germination features were greater in the hydropriming group than in the non-primed control, excluding RSDW ( Table 2 ). The majority of germination matrices were better in the TU and proline groups than the halopriming with 100 mM NaCl. Seed priming with PEG increased all germination parameters, and the relative values of most features, including RVI, RSL, RRFW, RRDW, and others, were higher in the PEG treatments than in the other treatments ( Table 2 ).

A relative value greater than 1 or less than 1 indicates that the trait is higher or lower than in the control. Different letters within a column indicate significant differences at p < 0.05. 3.3. The correlation coefficient among germination parameters The correlation coefficient analysis for different germination parameters depicted two distinct groupings with closely related characteristics ( Fig. 3 ). RGP, RGR, RGI, and RVI belonged to one group, whereas RSFW, RRFW, RSDW, RRDW, RSL, and RRL, belonged to the other group with closely related features. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. The RGP was substantially linked with RVI, RRL, and RSL with correlation values of 0.72, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively. The RGI showed a correlation with RSL and RVI with correlation values of 0.63 and 0.81, respectively. A significant correlation was also found between RSL and RSDW having correlation values of 0.68 and 0.70, respectively. Fig. 3.

Principal component analysis The influence of several priming agents on B. oleracea L. var. botrytis germination characteristics under salt stress was studied using principal component analysis (PCA). The components PC1 and PC2 explained 61.18% and 15.78% of the total variance, respectively ( Fig. 4 ). The major impacts of different priming agents on germination traits were precisely scattered on the PC1 axis in the pattern of 20% PEG > 10% PEG> 3 mM TU> 5 mM TU> 30% PEG> 10 mM Proline> 50 mM NaCl> 20 mM Proline> 25 mM NaCl> 5 mM Proline> 1 mM TU> HP> 100 mM NaCl. The PEG treatments had greater PC1 scores and were clustered on the right side of the PC1 axis, meanwhile, the lower scoring treatments were majorly on the left. PCA revealed increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. Fig. 4.

The loading matrix of a specific principal component was used to represent the level of correlation among germinative traits and the principal component ( Table 3 ). PC1 demonstrated substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes. PC2 exhibited significant positive relationships with growth indices, but negative associations were observed in terms of RGP, RGR, RVI, and RGI. This means that PC1 indicated all germination but PC2 showed the inverse correlations between RGR, RGP, RGI, RVI, and other growth indices. Table 3. Loading matrix for principal components.

Cluster analysis According to Ward's approach of systematic categorization, the 13 distinct priming treatments were classified into three groups in cluster analysis ( Fig. 5 ). The 1 mM TU, HP, and 100 mM NaCl treatments were in the first group, and they had a smaller effect on seed germination under salt stress than the other treatments. The 20% PEG and 30% PEG treatments were in the second group, and they had the best effect on seed germination in salty circumstances. The third group, which included the 5 mM proline, 20 mM proline, 10 mM Proline, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM TU, 3 mM TU, 25 mM NaCl, and 10% PEG treatments, showed increased germination traits under salinity stress conditions, relatively to a lower extent.

Effect of priming on protein, proline, and MDA content Priming has a significant impact on protein, proline, and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings ( Fig. 6 ). The salinity stress gradually reduced the protein content with increasing salt concentration compared to the control. Among the different priming agents, TU showed a greater effect on increasing protein content (19.52%) in seedlings grown under salt stress than the control compared to all other priming treatments ( Fig. 6 B). It was observed that the proline content was increased in all priming treatments compared to unprimed seedlings. Seedlings growing only in salt conditions without a primer reduced protein content by 36.35% than control in comparison to all other treatments. Seedlings primed with proline have the proline content increased 2 to 3-fold in all primed treatment in compared to control has the lowest proline content ( Fig. 6 C). Priming has been shown to be an effective method to mitigate the stress-induced formation of MDA and reactive oxygen species. Lipid peroxidation indicated by MDA content was differentially reduced in a dose-dependent and priming agent-specific manner by application of the priming treatment compared to stressed seedlings ( Fig. 6 A). As a result, cauliflower seedlings derived from prepared seeds had greatly reduced MDA levels under salt stress conditions ( Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6. Open in a new tab Effects of seed priming under salt stress in Cauliflower seedlings. At 10 days post-incubation, non-primed no stress (NPN), no priming with salt stress (NPS), and primed with different priming agents under salt stress seedlings were harvested and analysed for MDA, proline, and soluble protein content.

Different low case letters above the bars indicate significant statistical differences between the treatments (p < 0.05). 3.7. Photosynthetic pigments and DAB staining It has been observed that chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments are susceptible to salinity stress ( Fig. 7 ). The primed B. oleracea L. var. botrytis seedlings showed a much-reduced rate of photosynthetic pigments degradation under saline conditions in comparison to non-primed seedlings. Seed priming with different priming agents, viz. proline, PEG, TU, NaCl, and H 2 O remarkably improved the chl a, chl b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid content in B. oleracea L. var. botrytis seedlings under salinity stress in a dose-dependent manner. The Chl a, Chl b, and total chlorophyll were increased at 1.95 fold, 3.38 fold and 2.15 fold in Pro 10 mM, Pro 20 mM, and Pro 10 mM, respectively while carotenoidswere highly increased (2 fold) on 20 mM PEG compared to all treatments. The DAB staining results showed that unprimed leaves exhibited a distinct brown stain after treatment with a higher salinity (100 mM), indicating greater ROS accumulation compared to primed leaves ( Fig. 8 ). Overall, salt stress, which produced large amounts of peroxide radicals, alleviated, while all plants treated with priming agents mitigated the effects of the stress by preventing peroxide radical production.

    "Conclusion": "Salt stress can easily stunt Brassica growth, especially during germination. In this study, salt stress greatly reduced cauliflower germination as evidenced by reductions in germination potential, germination rate, germination index, and vigor index, and inhibition of seedling development. Under salt stress, seed germination can be suppressed or delayed for a variety of reasons. First, salinity significantly slows seedling growth and affects typical morphologies throughout the seedling stage by disrupting a number of vital fundamental cellular processes that alter the rate of emergence and growth, particularly in glycophytes [ 66 ]. Second, salt stress has been linked to ion toxicity and osmotic stress in cellular metabolic processes, resulting in lower turgor pressure due to increased negative water potential, both of which affect growth traits such as shoot root length, plant vigor, seedling growth, and biomass [ [67] , [68] , [69] , [70] ]. Therefore, the main consequence of salt stress is a reduction in the cell division process, resulting in reduced development of the internodes, contributing to reduced growth and elongation of shoots, reduced leaf elongation, and rapid cell death [ 1 , [71] , [72] , [73] ]. Increasing salt tolerance and using appropriate management techniques to counteract the negative effects of salinity on salt-sensitive species is one of the most important and difficult management tasks [ 74 ]. Therefore, seed priming is the effective and ancient method to reduce the negative effects of various abiotic stresses [ [75] , [76] , [77] ]. Various priming techniques have been applied to seeds of many crops to help them overcome growth barriers and establish themselves more successfully in harsh climatic conditions [ [78] , [79] , [80] , [81] , [82] ]. Priming improves water uptake, causing the cell cycle in the G2 phase to proceed faster in pre-treated seeds than in non-pre-treated seeds, which can lead to cell synchronization [ 83 ], increased sugar content, organically producing compounds and modifying the Metabolic activities during seed germination and ultimately lead to uniform and better development of seedlings [ 84 ]. So pre-treating seeds with chemical agents, which create a moderate stress-like signal, permits the establishment of a “priming memory,” that improves tolerance when the plant is subjected to various abiotic stress in the future [ 85 , 86 ]. In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the effects of different priming techniques such as hydro-, halo- and osmopriming using appropriate priming agents such as water, NaCl, proline, PEG and TU on B. oleracea under salt stress and the results showed that all priming agents tested enhanced the germination indices of cauliflower seeds under salt stress over the unprimed group ( Table 2 ). All priming techniques proved beneficial to improve germination indices and growth parameters, i.e., GP, GR, SVI, RL, SL, SDW and RDW significantly in B. oleracea under salinity regime ( Table 2 ). Salt stress increases ROS production by causing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, leading to disruption of biochemical and physiochemical activities [ [87] , [88] , [89] , [90] ]. MDA level is a lipid peroxidation indicator that is more visible in salt sensitive plants compared to salt tolerant plants and can be used to determine the extent of oxidative damage, membrane rupture, DNA damage and cell death [ 91 , 92 ]. In the present study, the results showed that MDA levels were increased over control in non-primed cauliflower seedlings (NPS) grown under salt stress ( Fig. 6 A). All tested priming treatments were found beneficial to counteract the salinity stress responses differentially with respect to MDA content ( Fig. 6 A). In cauliflower seedlings treated with halo-priming (NaCl-priming), MDA content increased steadily with increasing NaCl-priming concentrations ( Fig. 6 A). In contrast, in osmoprimed (PEG-primed) seedlings, MDA content was gradually reduced with an increase in PEG levels. Thiourea and proline priming reduced MDA content in a dose-specific manner and was effective over hydro-priming alone ( Fig. 6 A). Similar results have been observed in previous findings showing that MDA concentrations decrease in certain radish cultivars while increasing in others under saline conditions [ [93] , [94] , [95] ]. However, in the control seedling, a lower level of MDA was observed with no primer and no salt stress (NPN) treatment. Thus, the present results showed that the MDA content of seedlings sprout from prepared seeds decreased significantly, indicating that these seedlings were better protected against salt stress. Ibrahim (2016) examined the benefits of seed priming in combating salt-induced lipid peroxidation and inhibition of MDA build-up (Ibrahim, 2016). MDA formation in prepared seedlings is hampered by the activation of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms, as evidenced by maize research [ 96 ]. The first organelle to be altered by salt stress is the cell membrane, since polyunsaturated fatty acids are one of the membrane lipid components most susceptible to peroxidation during times of stress. Increased membrane permeability causes lipid peroxidation, which compromises membrane integrity [ 97 ]. Among the organic solutes, proline has been shown to maintain cellular osmotic potential, stabilize membranes, and detoxify toxic ions in salt-stressed plants [ [98] , [99] , [100] , [101] ]. The accumulation of proline in salt-stressed plants was therefore considered as a predictive factor for salt tolerance. In the current study, the proline content in the untreated salt stress (NPS) control is higher than in the no-prime and no-stress (NPN) treatment control, but significantly lower than in primed treatments ( Fig. 6 C). All priming treatments on cauliflower seeds significantly improved proline accumulation with increasing concentration of the respective priming agents in the cauliflower seedlings grown under the salt stress regime ( Fig. 6 C). However, halopriming (NaCl priming) and proline priming proved very beneficial in terms of proline accumulation among all attempted priming treatments. However, the lowest level of proline was found in the case of hydropriming alone, although it was much greater than the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control and was considerably similar to seedlings primed with lower concentrations of PEG and TU ( Fig. 6 C). The current results showed that proline concentrations in cabbage increased with increasing salinity, consistent with previous results in salt-sensitive Napa cabbages [ 102 ]. It has been suggested that proline amino acid aggregation occurs more frequently than other amino acids in stressful environments and may be a factor in osmotic management and regulation of plant enzyme activity [ 103 , 104 ]. Accumulation of proline amino acids protects plant tissues from stress by acting as a fixative enzyme that reduces lipid peroxidation by improving membrane integrity and reducing cell membrane breakdown [ [105] , [106] , [107] , [108] ]. In the current studies, the results showed that the non-primed control seedlings with no salt stress (NPN) were high in protein, while the non-primed control seedlings grown under salt stress (NPS) were lower in protein ( Fig. 6 B). When halo-primed (NaCl treatment), the protein content increased with increasing NaCl concentration from 25 mM NaCl to 50 mM NaCl and decreased when priming with 100 mM NaCl. When osmoprimed with proline and PEG, the protein content increased with increasing concentration of the priming agent. Higher concentrations of both priming agents, PEG and thiourea, showed the highest total soluble protein content in cauliflower seedlings grown under salt stress. However, water-primed seeds also slightly increased protein content, but the overall gain was much higher in the case of halo, TU, PEG, and proline priming ( Fig. 6 B). The growth of the free amino acid pool due to hydrolysis of protein during the osmotic adjustment process may account for the increase in total soluble protein under salt stress. Seed priming enhanced accumulation of all soluble proteins under a variety of abiotic stressors [ [109] , [110] , [111] , [112] ]. Future research should address the mechanism by which seed preparation increases total protein content. In the present study, a reduction in Chl a, Chl b and total Chl was observed in the unprimed salt stressed (NPS) control, however, high chlorophyll content was found in the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control ( Fig. 7 ). Interestingly, all priming approaches mitigated the deleterious effects of salinity on chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, and significantly enhanced photosynthetic pigments ( Fig. 7 A–D). Proline priming proved to be much more beneficial for enhancing photosynthetic pigments than hydropriming alone. Halopriming was the least effective for pigment enhancement compared to other priming approaches in cauliflower. Salinity has a significant impact on all developmental traits. However, different treatments showed different responses to salinity sensitivity. Fig. 7 showed that the hydroprimed and NaCl pre-treated seedlings had no significant difference in Chl b but increased Chl a and total Chl in the NaCl pre-treated seedlings. The amount of photosynthetic pigments in plant leaves is affected by increased concentrations of Na + and Cl − [ 113 , 114 ]. However, it has been discovered that as salinity increases, chlorophyll levels decrease. Salinity stress causes a reduction in chlorophyll concentration, which could be due to its negative effects on membrane integrity, decreased biosynthesis, or rapid pigment degradation [ 115 , 116 ]. It has also been observed that the long-term effects of salt cause the development of chlorophyll-protein-lipid complexes to be disrupted [ 117 ]. In the present study, seed primed with Pro, PEG and TU significantly increased total chlorophyll compared to hydropriming in salt stress ( Fig. 7 C). In the current investigation, proline priming significantly increased chlorophyll content, and proline treatment was also reported to favourably affect Chl a and total chlorophyll content in salt-stressed S. bicolor [ 118 ].",
