    "Abstract": "Abstract Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137 Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

All bars are mean ± SEM. 2.1. Viral Load Viral copy number is used to determine whether actual viral replication occurs from radiation as compared with the controls (non-irradiated cells but traveled to and from BNL with the irradiated cells). When analyzing all radiation sources together ( Figure 1 (A1)), 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy CMV viral loads were significantly higher ( p < 0.001) as compared with controls throughout the entire experiment but also increased in the following order: control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0. As shown in Figure 1 (A1), the post-irradiation viral load in the CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells decreased in controls as well as in all four radiation doses as compared with the pre-irradiation values (a separate set of the flasks for individual types of radiation but not irradiated). However, when the data were analyzed by timepoint (regardless of dose) ( Figure 1 (A2)), control and radiation both increased (non-significantly) post-radiation at Day 3 from an average of 18.27 to 23.53 and 22.21 copies/10,000 cells, respectively, and then tapered off as the experiment went on. Differences in viral load between control and radiation did not significantly occur until Day 12 (5.8 vs. 8.8 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.001) and Day 15 (5.2 vs. 8.2 copies/10,000 cells, p < 0.01) ( Figure 1 (A2)). Within Day 12 and Day 15 ( Figure 1 (A3)), CMV viral load increased sequentially as dose increased, with all doses significantly different from control except for 0.1 Gy at Day 15. When sorting out the data from each radiation source, proton and gamma showed an increase in CMV viral load at Day 3 post-irradiation compared with the pre-irradiation samples ( Figure 1 (D2,E2)). All other radiation types, carbon, iron, and GCRsim, showed a decrease at Day 3 post-irradiation from their pre-irradiation levels ( Figure 1 (B2,C2,F2)). However, when analyzing irradiated samples by dose ( Figure 1 -column 1) compared with the controls, all radiation sources (except gamma) showed significant increases of CMV viral load, with the most increases seen in iron ion radiation at 2.0 Gy (+4.50 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1 (C1)) and carbon 2.0 Gy (+2.87 CMV copies/10,000 cells, Figure 1 (B1)). As mentioned previously, when analyzed according to different time points post-irradiation ( Figure 1 -column 2), the viral load increased or was roughly the same as the pre-irradiation values and then started to decrease on Days 6, 9, 12, and 15 for all the radiation sources. Significant differences compared with controls were found in proton and GCRsim at Day 9 ( p < 0.001) ( Figure 1 (E2,F2)) and carbon and iron at Day 12 ( p < 0.001) ( Figure 1 (B2,C2)). We also compared the results of viral load post each irradiation type and at each timepoint with their own respective controls ( Figure 1 -column 3). Viral load values were consistently higher post-radiation as compared with the control samples at each time point for all the experiments except for carbon and iron on Day 9 ( Figure 1 (B3,C3)) and gamma on Day 3 ( Figure 1 (D3)), which showed a decrease post-irradiation. A significant increase was observed 12 days post-irradiation for all sources as compared with their controls ( Figure 1 (A3)). For individual radiation types, carbon and iron showed an effect 3 days and beyond post-radiation ( Figure 1 (B3,C3)), while proton and GCRsim did not show any significant effect until 9 days post-irradiation ( Figure 1 (E3,F3)). Gamma did show an increasing trend, but this difference was not statistically significant ( Figure 1 (D3)). 2.2. Cell Viability The cell viability was 86.3 to 89.9% before the cells were transported to NSRL (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). The trauma of transport negatively affected cell viability of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV, as evidenced by the substantial reduction in live cells in the control conditions ( Figure 2 ). Radiation further significantly reduced the viability at all the dosages in an increasing order (control < 0.1 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 2.0) when compared with the controls for all sources ( Figure 2 (A1)). As represented in Figure 2 (A2), the viability started to recover 9 days post-irradiation (controls: 70.25 ± 2.20%; radiation: 58.39 ± 2.12%) as compared with Day 3 (controls: 44.56 ± 2.57%; radiation: 41.89 ± 1.00%) and Day 6 (controls: 43.23 ± 1.86%; radiation: 39.96 ± 1.10%). The irradiated groups were significantly less viable than their corresponding controls at each timepoint ( p < 0.001) except for Day 6 ( Figure 2 (A2)). The biggest fall was found at 2.0 Gy irradiation compared with controls at every timepoint analyzed ( p < 0.001, Figure 2 (A3)). When sorting out each radiation source, proton and gamma showed the least reduction in viability compared with controls (max reduction at 2.0 Gy: proton = −5.94%, Figure 2 (E1), and gamma = −10.93%, Figure 2 (D1)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim (except GCRsim 0.1 Gy, Figure 2 (B1,C1,F1)) all showed significant decreases in cell viability compared with controls, with the most decreases seen in iron 2.0 Gy (−26.42%) and carbon 2.0 Gy (−17.81%). Proton and gamma radiation had significant reductions in viability at Day 12 ( p < 0.01, Figure 2 (D2,E2)), which were driven in large part by the higher dose radiations at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy ( Figure 2 (D3,E3)). Gamma radiation also had a significant reduction in viability at Day 15 ( p < 0.001, Figure 2 (D2)). Carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had significant reductions in viability at Days 9 and 12 ( Figure 2 (B2,C2,F2)), with the higher doses contributing to that the most ( Figure 2 (B3,C3,F3)). Carbon and iron also had reductions in viability at Days 3 and 15 ( Figure 2 (B2,C2)). 2.3. Cell Size The normal size of Kasumi-3 cells infected with CMV is around 9.0 µm. In our data set, pre-irradiation cell size ranged from 9.2 to 9.4 µm (i.e., pre-irradiation values from each experiment). Post-irradiation saw a general increase in the size of these cells as compared with their respective controls for all the sources ( Figure 3 (A1)). However, a significant increase was only found at 2.0 Gy irradiation dose for all the sources (9.5 ± 0.1 to 10.1 ± 0.2; p < 0.001, Figure 3 (A1)), but is evident by the fact that each individual radiation source had a significant cell size increase at 2.0 Gy ( Figure 3 (B1–E1)). For individual sources, iron showed a significant increase at 2.0 Gy ( Figure 3 (C1)), carbon showed at 1.0 and 2.0 Gy ( Figure 3 (B1)), gamma was significant at all doses ( Figure 3 (D1)), proton showed at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy ( Figure 3 (E1)), and GCRsim showed at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy ( Figure 3 (F1)), respectively. It was interesting to notice that this increase was observed 9 days post-irradiation for all sources ( Figure 3 (A2)) and at individual sources gamma and protons ( Figure 3 (D2,E2)). For post-GCRsim irradiation treatment, an increase in cell size was apparent even three days after treatment for doses of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy ( Figure 3 (E2,E3)). Similar to the other individual radiation sources, GCRsim cell sizes also increased at Day 9 ( Figure 3 (E2)), which coincided with a dose of 2.0 Gy having statistical significance, which continued into Day 12s and 15 ( Figure 3 (E3)). 2.4. Genomics Kasumi cells from the above experiments were subjected to genomic analysis in order to reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms or other possible variations in the genomes of irradiated cells compared with mock. For this purpose, total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi-3 cells from the above experiment. The recovered TNA was subjected to DNA analysis. The same TNA was also used for transcriptional analysis described below. The initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal statistically significant genomic variants upon comparison among the groups. This finding indicates that there were no stable genomic alterations induced by irradiation during this study. 2.5. Transcriptomics The TNA recovered from this study was also examined for differences in transcriptional activity of the CMV genome in the irradiated and unirradiated groups. Data from the GCR-Day 6 cells compared with mock-exposed cells indicate that differential expression seems to be occurring, but these changes do not register as statistically significant ( Supplemental Document S2 ). However, the UL49 sequence shows a significant ( p < 0.026) increase in expression reflected as log Fold Change (logFC) of 1.48, summarized in Supplemental Document S1 .",
    "Conclusion": "Herpes viral reactivations in astronauts have generally been subclinical. However, medical events with viral etiology have occurred during spaceflight [ 10 ]. The cause of those reactivations, whether symptomatic or not, is not fully understood. Spaceflight imposes a multitude of stressors on the human body that can potentially directly (i.e., space radiation, microgravity) or indirectly (i.e., dysregulated immunity) cause the reactivation of herpes viruses. Our group has previously shown that lytic gene transcription of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), which is consistently elevated in astronaut samples, is directly activated by a variety of radiation types and doses [ 9 ]. In the current study, we examined how ionizing radiation reactivated cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the Kasumi-3 myeloblast cell line. The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. In the current study, we tested the effect of carbon, iron, proton, gamma, and GCRsim individually across several doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy) on CMV viral load, genomics, and transcriptomics. The CMV viral load in the infected Kasumi cells, taken as a whole, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, with increases seen at Day 3 at all the dosages tested, which tapered off through Day 15. However, at Days 12 and 15, the most significant viral load changes were seen at almost all doses compared with their corresponding controls. Surprisingly, however, carbon, iron, and GCRsim all had viral loads at Day 3 in controls and radiation groups that were either similar to or less than their respective pre-irradiation levels ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, no radiation (at any dose) produced an increase in CMV at Day 3 or Day 6 compared with the control samples. In other words, if an increase in CMV viral load was seen early on for post-irradiation cells, it also occurred in the control flasks. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the loss of cell viability resulting from cell transport from JSC to NSRL. Cells experience harsh conditions at the loading docks before and after shipping, including suboptimal temperature, humidity, and %CO 2 . Ideally, cell cultures would be undisturbed outside of experimental conditions, sample aliquoting, and media changes. However, with the NSRL facility located in New York, it was not feasible to do the many months-long pre-irradiation cell culture and infections outside our primary NASA facility at JSC. Based on our previous experiments using the latently infected EBV Akata cells, we did not anticipate such dampening of the experimental findings from the logistics of travel. We found that the cell viability decreased from 88.33% (before radiation) to 44.56% in controls and 41.89% in the irradiated groups (at Day 3 after radiation), accounting for a significant drop in the live cell count and, in turn, viral load. Even though the cell viability recovered after irradiation, the cell numbers never returned to the pre-irradiation levels. Even so, as the cells “settled down” and returned to the regulated physico-chemical conditions over time, differences between the controls and the radiation samples became apparent, as evidenced by the significant viral loads during the experimental timeline (particularly Days 12 and 15). The most significant increase in the CMV load as compared with their corresponding controls was found at Day 9 for post-proton and GCRsim irradiations, at 12 days post-iron and carbon irradiations, and at Day 15 for carbon, iron, and GCRsim. On the contrary, our previous studies showed that gamma rays were more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of lytic gene transcription of EBV. Even though EBV and CMV are both herpesviruses, their replication and response mechanisms are expected to be different. Additionally, the Akata cell line (B-cell lymphoma) and the Kasumi-3 cell line (myeloblast leukemia) are different, and it may be that the Akata cells are just a more robust cell line and can handle perturbations in the cell culture conditions more easily. Not surprisingly, then, in normal human immunology, cells of the myeloid lineage generally have a shorter lifespan and faster turnover rate (days to weeks) than cells of the lymphoid system (weeks to months) [ 11 , 12 ]. Future studies should limit dyshomeostasis to the cell culture system or use a more stable model (in vivo or in vitro) to confirm these results. In-depth correlation analysis of CMV genomes and transcriptomes before and after radiation exposure has the potential to identify specific loci or nucleotide changes due to radiation exposure. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells ( Supplemental Document S2 ). Interestingly, only UL49 showed a significantly elevated level (LogFC 1.48, p value 0.026) in GCRsim-Day6 cells compared with mock. UL49 is an essential subunit of the viral pre-initiation complex that regulates viral gene expression [ 13 ]. UL49 displays leaky late expression kinetics and is localized to the nuclear replication compartments. UL49 serves as a fundamental HCMV effector that governs viral gene transcription required to complete the replication cycle. It is likely that the GCRsim-mediated reactivation of CMV may be related to over expression of UL49. Efforts to grow a UL49 virus in the laboratory were unsuccessful. The radiation track structure likely plays an important role in CMV reactivation; however, this role is not clear. In general, the viral load is the highest 3 days post-irradiation and then decreases. The decay is the fastest for low-LET gamma rays and protons and slower for high-LET carbon and iron ions. The GCRsim follows the same trend, in-between low-LET and high-LET. We have also observed similar trends in our previous study on radiation-induced EBV reactivation [ 9 ]. It is possible that for a given dose, more of the DNA of the cell is affected by low-LET than high-LET radiation, which may favor viral reactivation. High-LET radiation tends to deposit energy in a more concentrated way than low-LET radiation. That leads to more damage to DNA and other structures, or more complex DNA damage, but the cell may die when the DNA damage is too complex to repair or when there is too much damage. Indeed, the viability of cells decreases similarly for most types of radiation 3 days post-irradiation. However, the viability of cells irradiated by protons and gamma recovers more than those irradiated by carbon and iron ions. Regarding cell size, the trends are harder to put into evidence. The changes in cell size observed may be due to the cytopathic effect on replication of HCMV. The cell size decreases slightly 3 days post-irradiation for all radiation types but returns (and even surpasses) the pre-irradiation size 6 days post-irradiation. The cell size increases the most with those irradiated with carbon and iron ions, especially at high doses. The cell size of those irradiated with GCRsim is similar to that of those irradiated by high-LET radiation. To our knowledge, we have produced the only two studies that report the reactivation of herpesviruses (EBV and CMV) by spaceflight simulated radiation. However, medical research and cancer treatments have observed the reactivation of CMV by chemo- and radiotherapy for quite some time [ 14 ]. While reactivation is generally considered a by-product of reduced immune surveillance by an ablated immune system, case reports exist of radiotherapies causing suspected CMV reactivation and subsequent life-threatening pathologies [ 15 ]. The authors noted in their case report that the adverse effects (neurological deterioration) occurred during or shortly after radiation therapy and that successful administration of antiviral treatment greatly improved the surviving patients’ conditions. Additionally, CMV promoters, like IE-1, are used for innumerable studies to drive the expression of transgenes. A few studies have reported that radiation can induce activation of CMV promoters to overexpress transgenes of interest and thus enhance therapeutic delivery [ 16 ]. For example, Jung et al. in 2011 [ 17 ] found that radiation-induced expression of the CMV IEX-1 promoter (pIEX-TNF-α) increased TNF-α sensitization of cancer cells, leading to enhanced tumor regression in a xenograft model. These articles as well as our data presented here support the idea that increased radiation received through spaceflight may lead to direct reactivations of herpesviruses independent of the known mechanism of immune dysregulation.",
