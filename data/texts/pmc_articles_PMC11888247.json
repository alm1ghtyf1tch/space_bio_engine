    "Results": "C. albicans colonization in female mice reduces ethanol consumption. Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans as described ( 25 ). We previously showed that inoculation did not result in significant changes in bacterial microbiota composition and did not evoke significant inflammation ( 25 ). Colonized and mock-colonized mice were subjected to a continuous access two-bottle choice experiment where mice were given access to two sipper tubes containing water or 15% ethanol simultaneously as described in Materials and Methods . Ethanol consumption and ethanol preference showed reductions on both days of the protocol in C. albicans -colonized mice compared to mock-colonized mice (mock) ( Figures 1A , B ). C. albicans -colonized mice consumed slightly less total liquid than mock on day 1 and the same amount of liquid on day 2. Both groups drank less total liquid than mice only given access to water (H2O-only) ( Figure 1C ). Colony forming units/gram of fecal pellets (FP) or cecum contents (CC) demonstrated the presence of C. albicans in the GI tract of inoculated mice throughout the experiment ( Figure 1D ). From these results, we concluded that C. albicans colonization reduced ethanol consumption in female mice. Figure 1: C. albicans-colonized mice consume significantly less ethanol and have lower ethanol preference than mock-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS. After inoculation, mice were subjected to a 2-bottle choice experiment, with one bottle of 15% ethanol (vol/vol) and one bottle of water. Liquid consumption was measured by weighing the bottles daily. (A) Ethanol consumption (gm ethanol/kg body weight) on the first and second day of access to ethanol.

(F) CFU/gm fecal pellets from the saccharin preference experiment. Symbols as in panel D.

A two-way ANOVA corrected for repeated measures was performed for statistics (* p=0.0144; ** p<0.0035; *** p<0.0003; **** p<0.0001). Saccharin preference was tested to determine whether C. albicans colonized mice showed alterations in preference to other rewarding substances ( 27 ). Saccharin preference was measured in a similar continuous access two-bottle choice experiment as described in Materials and Methods . Saccharin preference per day showed no effect of C. albicans colonization ( Figure 1E ). CFU/gram of FP or CC showed colonization throughout the experiment ( Figure 1F ). These results showed that C. albicans colonization did not exert broad effects on consumption of all rewarding substances. Rather, the effects were more selective. C. albicans -colonized mice have elevated serum PGE 2 and PGE 2 injection reduces murine ethanol preference. Levels of PGE 2 were measured in serum obtained from C. albicans -colonized or mock-colonized mice following two days of ethanol consumption. Since PGE 2 is not a stable molecule, concentrations of a metabolite of PGE 2 , 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE 2 (PGE-m), commonly utilized as a marker for PGE 2 ( 28 ), were assayed by ELISA. The assay showed that C. albicans -colonized mice had elevated serum PGE-m levels compared to H 2 O-only or mock groups ( Figure 2A ). Figure 2. C. albicans-colonized mice have elevated serum PGE 2 and injection of dmPGE 2 reduced ethanol consumption. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1 . On day 2, mice were euthanized, and serum was collected. (A) PGE-metabolite concentration, standardized to the average in mock-colonized mice within each experiment.

One-way ANOVA was performed for statistical analysis (*, p<0.0354) (B) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously once per day with dmPGE 2 (concentrations as shown) or vehicle and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1 .

To test the effect of elevated PGE 2 on ethanol consumption, a 4 day, two-bottle choice experiment was performed in which mice were injected with 16,16-dimethyl PGE 2 (dm-PGE 2 ), a commonly-used, stable derivative of PGE 2 ( 29 ). Mice received either vehicle or one of four different concentrations of dm-PGE 2 (25, 50, 100, 300 ug/kg) by subcutaneous injection each day. Lower concentrations (25 or 50 ug/kg) of dm-PGE 2 led to low-level decreases in ethanol preference and consumption, and higher concentrations led to larger decreases compared to PBS-injected mice ( Figures 2B , C ). Thus, dm-PGE 2 injection in mice decreased ethanol consumption in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the model that elevation of endogenous PGE 2 results in decreased ethanol consumption. EP Receptor Antagonism Increases Ethanol Consumption and Preference to Mock-Colonized Levels. Based on these results, we hypothesized that PGE 2 is a key driver of reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans -colonized mice. To test this hypothesis, female mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans or mock-colonized with PBS and injected with 2 g/kg each of an EP1 antagonist (SC-51089, Cayman Chemical) and an EP2 antagonist (TG6–10-1, Cayman Chemical) subcutaneously each day of the 2 day two-bottle choice experiment. Mock-colonized mice injected with vehicle or antagonist showed no difference in ethanol consumption or preference ( Figure 3A , B ). Mice that were colonized with C. albicans and injected with vehicle showed significantly lower ethanol consumption and preference compared to other groups. Those injected with antagonists showed significantly higher ethanol consumption and preference on day 1 and a trend towards an increase in ethanol consumption on day 2. Some reductions in total liquid consumed in C. albicans -colonized, vehicle-injected mice were observed ( Figure 3C ). Mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment ( Figure 3D ). Figure 3. EP receptor antagonism elevates C. albicans-colonized mouse ethanol consumption to mock-colonized levels in female and male mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice (A-D) or male C57BL/6 mice (E-H) were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS, injected subcutaneously with EP1 antagonist (SC-51089, 2 g/kg) and EP2 antagonist (TG6–10-1, 2 g/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1 .

(D, H) shows CFU/gram of fecal pellet on each day of collection. FP, fecal pellets; CC, cecum contents. Black circles ( C. albicans with vehicle) or black triangles ( C. albicans with antagonists) show individual mice. Geometric means are shown by bars, and geometric standard deviation is shown by error bars. Two-way ANOVA performed for statistics. We also tested whether male mice had a reduction in ethanol consumption following C. albicans colonization and whether this phenotype could be reversed by EP antagonists. A trend towards reduction in ethanol consumption by the vehicle injected, C. albicans -colonized mice was observed on day 2 of ethanol consumption, and total liquid-consumed was also reduced ( Figures 3E , F , G ). These mice had stable colonization throughout the experiment ( Figure 3H ). These results support the model that activation of EP1/EP2 receptors in C. albicans -colonized mice decreases their ethanol consumption and preference. Further experiments were conducted with females only since females showed strong effects of colonization. Increased Serum PGE 2 in C. albicans -colonized Mice Correlates with Gene Expression in the Brain. We next tested the hypothesis that C. albicans gut colonization and elevation of PGE 2 concentration would result in transcriptomic changes in the brain. PGE 2 binds to its cognate receptors encoded by four different genes, Ep1 , Ep2 , Ep3 , and Ep4 ( 30 ). PGE 2 has been shown to upregulate expression of Ep receptor genes in a dose dependent manner in neuronal cell lines and various tissues in the body( 31 , 32 ). We decided to focus on a region of the brain involved in habit formation, the dorsal striatum (DS) ( 33 ), as well as other addiction-implicated regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)( 34 ). To test the hypothesis, RT-qPCR from DS-cDNA was performed and expression of Ep1 and Ep2 relative mock-colonized from the same experimental trial was measured. There were no significant differences in Ep receptor expression between groups in the DS, PFC, or NAc ( Figure S1 ). However, correlations between PGE-m concentration in the serum and relative expression of Ep1 or Ep2 in the same C. albicans -colonized mouse were observed. Gene expression relative to the average for mock-colonized was plotted against the concentration of PGE-m (also standardized to mock-colonized). Figure 4A , B demonstrates that mice with higher concentrations of serum PGE 2 exhibited higher expression of Ep1 and Ep2 . In mock-colonized mice, there were no significant correlations ( Figure 4C , D ). We observed similar significant correlations of Ep1 expression and PGE-m concentration in the PFC and NAc ( Figure S2 ). Elevated PGE 2 levels were thus associated with higher expression of Ep receptors in multiple regions of the brain. Figure 4. Serum PGE-metabolite correlates with EP Receptor expression in the dorsal striatum in C. albicans-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1 . On day 2, mice were euthanized, and brain and serum were collected. Expression of Ep genes relative to average expression in mock-colonized mice from the same experimental trial, plotted as a function of concentration of PGE-metabolite standardized to the average in mock-colonized mice in the same experimental trial. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. (A,B) C. albicans -colonized mice (black circles) (C,D) mock-colonized mice (open circles). (A,C) Ep1 (B,D) Ep2 . Pearson correlations were used to test for significant correlations, r=correlation strength and p=statistical significance. Significant correlations were observed between Ep1 and Ep2 expression and concentration of PGE-M in C. albicans -colonized mice. We also analyzed the expression of dopamine receptors in the DS of these mice. The dopamine system in the DS is commonly involved with learning and habit formation ( 35 ). Expression of two main classes of dopamine receptors, Drd1 and Drd2 , was measured ( 36 ). A trend towards a reduction in Drd1 expression and a statistically significant reduction in Drd2 expression in C. albicans -colonized mice compared to mock-colonized were observed ( Figure 5A ). Additionally, mice injected with low-dose dm-PGE 2 (25 or 50ug/kg injections) showed reduced expression of Drd1 and Drd2 ( Figure 5B ). Interestingly, Drds showed no differences in expression in the PFC or NAc ( Figure S3 ). Furthermore, other addiction-related genes showed no significant differences in expression in the DS ( Figure S4 ). These results show that both C. albicans colonization and low-dose dm-PGE 2 injections reduce dopamine receptor expression in the DS. Figure 5. Both C. albicans colonization and low dose dmPGE2 injection result in lower Drd2 receptor expression in the Dorsal Striatum. Open in a new tab (A) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2-bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1 . On day 2, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the dorsal striatum of mock-colonized or C. albicans -colonized mice by real time RT qPCR using the ddCT method. (B) Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously each day with dmPGE 2 (low dose = 25 or 50 ug/kg; high dose = 100 or 300 ug/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the 2 bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1 . On day 4, mice were euthanized, and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the DS by RT-qPCR using the ddCT method. Outliers were removed with ROUT to determine mathematical outliers (Q=0.1% to remove definitive outliers). (A,B) Geometric means and geometric SDs are shown and Two-way ANOVA was performed for statistical significance. Expression of Drd1 or Drd2 in mock or C. albicans -colonized mice correlated with total ethanol consumed. In the dorsal striatum, DRD1 is involved with reward formation and DRD2 is involved with aversion formation ( 37 ). Plots of Drd expression and total ethanol consumed showed a significant positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumption in mock-colonized mice ( Figure 6A ) and a trend towards a positive correlation between Drd2 and total ethanol consumed ( Figure 6C ). In C. albicans -colonized mice, by contrast, a significant negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption was observed ( figure 6D ). No correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumed was observed in these mice ( Figure 6B ). Thus, C. albicans -colonized mice that consumed lower amounts of ethanol exhibited higher expression of the aversion-associated DRD2 receptor. Figure 6: Drd Expression correlates with ethanol consumption in mock and C. albicans-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS and subjected to the 2 bottle choice experiment as in Figure 1 . On day 2, mice were euthanized and brains were collected. Drd receptor expression was measured in the dorsal striatum of mock-colonized or C. albicans -colonized mice. Total ethanol consumption (gm/kg) is plotted as a function of relative Drd expression. Pearson correlation used to test for significant correlations, r=correlation strength and p=statistical significance. (A, C) mock-colonized mice. (B, D) C. albicans -colonized mice. (A, B) Drd1 fold change of relative expression. (C, D) Drd2 fold change of relative expression. Significant correlations between Drd1 expression and ethanol consumption by mock-colonized mice and Drd2 expression and ethanol consumption by C. albicans colonized mice were observed. Candida albicans colonization accelerates the onset of conditioned taste aversion in mice. Based on the low ethanol consumption and negative correlation between Drd2 expression and ethanol consumption in C. albicans -colonized mice, we hypothesized that these mice would show enhanced ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Ethanol-induced CTA is based on the principle that mice will develop an aversion to a novel tasting solution when it is paired with an ethanol injection ( 38 , 39 ). Mice were tested for ethanol-induced CTA as described in Materials and Methods . The first exposure to the tastant showed the baseline consumption level, prior to injection (conditioning) with ethanol or control (sterile saline). Trials 2–4 showed consumption after conditioning, expressed as the change from initial consumption ( Figure 7A ). In trial 2, control mice showed similar or higher than baseline consumption of the tastant. Both mock-colonized and C. albicans -colonized mice injected with 3g/kg ethanol developed a near complete aversion to the tastant (100% reduction), which continued through trials 3 and 4. In contrast, mice given a lower concentration of ethanol (2g/kg) showed differences between groups. There was no significant aversion in the mock-colonized mice in trial 2 of this injection group and C. albicans -colonized mice showed a significant reduction in saline consumption compared to control mice in trial 2. On trial 3, both mock-colonized and C. albicans -colonized mice injected with 2g/kg ethanol showed significant aversion to the tastant. There were no differences in colonization or mouse weight throughout the experiment ( Figure 7B , S5 ). C. albicans -colonized mice thus developed ethanol-induced CTA more rapidly. Figure 7: C. albicans-colonized mice develop conditioned taste aversion more rapidly than mock-colonized mice. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were trained to drink their daily liquid in the late morning. Mice orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS were given one hour of access to a novel tastant, 1.2% saline solution, and then injected intraperitoneally with ethanol (2 g/kg or 3 g/kg) or control (sterile saline). Tastant consumption on the first trial (before injection with ethanol) was used as the baseline measurement and consumption on later trials was compared to trial 1. (A) percent change of tastant consumption relative to each individual mouse’s trial one consumption (pre-conditioned stimulus).

C. albicans -colonized mice are more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol and motor coordination deficits can be restored by EP receptor antagonism. The more rapid development of ethanol-induced CTA in C. albicans -colonized mice suggests these mice could be more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol as correlations between these phenotypes have been observed ( 40 ). Therefore, we tested whether C. albicans -colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol sedation, ethanol-induced motor coordination defects, and depressant effects of ethanol ( Figure 8A ). Figure 8: C. albicans-colonized mice are more sensitive to effects of ethanol. Open in a new tab Single housed female C57BL/6 mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans strain CKY101 or PBS on days 0 and 2, and subjected to the behavioral tests illustrated in panel (A). (B,C) Groups are defined as Mock +1x EtOH: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open circles); Mock + 3x EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open triangles); Ca + 1x EtOH: C. albicans -colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black circles); Ca + 3x EtOH: C. albicans -colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black triangles). ( D-F) Groups are defined as Mock + SS: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 (open circles); Mock + EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (open triangles); Ca + SS: C. albicans -colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 (black circles); Ca + EtOH: C. albicans -colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (black triangles). (G) Groups are defined as Ca/Mock + SS + Veh, fed C. albicans (black circles) or sterile PBS (open circles), received sterile saline and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Veh, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Ants, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and antagonist injections; Ca + Et + Veh, fed C. albicans , received ethanol and vehicle injections; Ca + Et + Ants, fed C. albicans , received ethanol and antagonist injections. All injections were IP, given before habituation or testing. Ethanol injections were 1.5g/kg of mouse weight and antagonists were 2g/kg of both EP1 and EP2 antagonists. (B) time after 3.5 g/kg ethanol injection (seconds) for the mouse to lose its righting reflex (LORR onset). (C) blood ethanol concentration (mg/dL) at the time of euthanization following LORR onset.

(E) total number of foot slips and “falls” during three trials of the balance beam test.

The first experiment was the open field activity test (OFT), which measures how susceptible C57BL/6 mice are to the depressant effects of alcohol based on the decrease in distance traveled in the OFT following ethanol injection (1.5 g/kg) ( 41 ). Mice were injected with ethanol (dose) or control (sterile saline [SS]) and distance traveled in 10 minutes in the OFT was measured. Results are expressed relative to the SS-injected mice within each experimental trial (mock or C. albicans -colonized) ( Figure 8B ). Results showed a significant reduction in distance traveled by C. albicans -colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to C. albicans -colonized, SS-injected mice. There was not a significant reduction in distance traveled by the mock-colonized, ethanol-injected mice compared to SS-injected mice. These results show that the C. albicans -colonized mice were more strongly affected by ethanol. The loss of righting reflex (LORR) experiment tested the ability of mice to right themselves after injection with a sedative amount of ethanol (3.5 g/kg) ( 42 ). The time for the mice to lose their righting reflex after the injection is termed LORR onset. Mock or C. albicans -colonized mice that had received SS injections the previous three days, or mock mice that received ethanol the previous 3 days had no differences in LORR onset ( Figure 8C ). C. albicans -colonized mice that received ethanol injections on the previous 3 days showed a significantly shorter LORR onset compared to all groups. Blood ethanol concentration from serum collected at the time of loss of righting reflex showed a trend towards higher levels in these mice ( Figure 8D ). These results indicate a synergistic effect of ethanol treatment (including prior treatment) and C. albicans -colonization that increased the sedative effects of ethanol. Motor coordination defects were tested using performance on the balance beam, which can measure coordination based on the number of slips and falls on the beam ( 43 ). Mice were injected with SS or ethanol and their performance was assessed. The total number of slips or falls throughout three trials ( Figure 8E ) and the total amount of time required to complete three trials were measured ( figure 8F ). Mock-colonized or C. albicans -colonized mice injected with SS did not slip/fall often and completed the trials quickly. Mock-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed a significant increase in slips and falls, consistent with ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits. C. albicans -colonized mice injected with ethanol showed significantly more slips and falls than any of the other groups and were significantly slower. Furthermore, there were no differences in colonization or mouse weight in these experiments ( Figure S6 ). Thus, C. albicans -colonized mice showed more ethanol-induced impairment in motor coordination. To test the hypothesis that PGE 2 signaling contributed to the differences in mouse susceptibility to the effects of ethanol, mice were injected with the combination of EP1 and EP2 antagonists (2mg/kg each) before each behavioral test. Total slips and falls on the balance beam test following these injections was measured. C. albicans -colonized mice injected with ethanol and antagonists showed a significant decrease in slips and falls compared to the ethanol and vehicle group ( Figure 8G ). There was no difference between the C. albicans -colonized group with ethanol and antagonists compared to either of the mock + ethanol injected groups. We did not see a similar reversal of phenotypes by antagonists in either the OFT or LORR ( Figure S7 ). These results showed that blocking PGE 2 signaling in C. albicans -colonized mice reduced their susceptibility to ethanol-induced impairment of motor control. Taken together, the results showed that C. albicans -colonized mice were more susceptible to the depressant and sedative effects of ethanol, and to ethanol-induced impairment in motor control. PGE 2 effects on EP1 and EP2 receptors make a major contribution to the mechanism of ethanol-induced motor impairment.",
    "Conclusion": "We demonstrate that C. albicans -colonization in mice reduces ethanol preference and consumption. Our results with EP1/EP2 antagonists show that PGE 2 signaling plays a significant role in modifying mouse ethanol preference. Further, injection of uncolonized mice with dm-PGE 2 reduced ethanol consumption. There was a somewhat dose-dependent response as low concentrations of dm-PGE 2 (25–50 ug/kg) reduced consumption moderately and higher doses of dm-PGE 2 (100–300ug/kg) reduced ethanol preference and consumption more strongly. Antibiotic treated mice with C. albicans gut colonization have been previously shown to exhibit elevated serum PGE-m levels ( 24 ). Mice treated with antibiotics but not inoculated with fungi showed a modest increase in serum PGE-m levels and this level was sufficient to promote inflammatory cell responses. C. albicans -colonized mice in our study, which did not use antibiotics, also showed modestly increased serum concentrations of PGE-m and PGE-m concentration correlated with ethanol preference. These results indicate that modest increases in serum PGE 2 are associated with changes in host immune responses and behavior. PGE 2 in circulation may be directly involved in these changes or may serve as a marker indicating higher levels of PGE 2 in multiple organs. In fact, we saw evidence of increased PGE 2 by correlations with Ep expression in all regions of the brain examined. PGE 2 has previously been shown to alter the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by inducing alterations in endothelial permeability or by stimulating the retraction of pericytes from the surface of the BBB ( 44 – 46 ). PGE 2 has also been shown to induce vasodilation ( 44 ). Vasodilatory effects and BBB alterations could lead to higher amounts of PGE 2 in the brain and reduce ethanol consumption. These results support the model that, as PGE 2 in the circulation elevates above normal fluctuating ranges, BBB permeability increases, and more PGE 2 can enter the brain, resulting in correlations between its concentration in serum and Ep1/Ep2 receptor expression in C. albicans -colonized mice. Synergy between the effects of C. albicans colonization and the effects of ethanol were also observed. Mice that received both ethanol and C. albicans were the only group with significantly reduced locomotion in the OFT. C. albicans -colonized mice that received multiple injections with ethanol showed significantly shorter time to LORR onset than C. albicans -colonized mice that received one injection. Ethanol also affects the BBB through changes in integrity and permeability ( 47 , 48 ). Inflammatory molecules such as LPS can also synergistically increase BBB permeability ( 49 ). The effects of ethanol on the BBB may thus synergize with the effects of PGE 2 , resulting in significant behavioral effects in colonized mice. Saccharin preference may not be reduced by C. albicans colonization because of the lack of an additional insult to the BBB. PGE 2 has previously been shown to affect the dopamine system. Dopamine is critical for habit, reward, and aversion formation ( 50 ). PGE 2 treatment altered reward learning to morphine in mice ( 51 , 52 ), and has been shown to alter DRD signaling and behavior following cocaine ingestion ( 53 ). We observed that C. albicans -colonized mice showed altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum. Expression of one of the receptors, Drd2 , was significantly decreased in C. albicans colonized mice and low-dose dm-PGE 2 -injected mice. Interestingly, expression in the PFC and NAc did not indicate similar changes to the dopamine system, and other genes implicated in addiction such as neuropeptide Y receptors, opioid receptors (Mu and Delta), proopiomelanocortin ( Pomc ), and Fos were unchanged. Significant expression differences of the Mu opioid receptor between mock and C. albicans -colonized mice appeared to be due to differences in ethanol consumption. These results indicate an altered regulation of the dopamine system in the DS observed in mice with low level increases in systemic PGE 2 concentrations. Furthermore, when Drd expression in the DS was plotted against total ethanol consumption, significant positive or negative correlations were observed. DRD1 and DRD2 receptors in the dorsal striatum have well defined, consistent roles. DRD1 signaling in the DS is mostly involved with reinforcement or reward learning and DRD2 is most commonly involved with aversion-formation ( 37 ). A positive correlation between Drd1 expression and total ethanol consumption was observed in mock-colonized mice, but not in C. albicans -colonized mice suggesting dysregulation of the relationship of DRD1/reinforcement in these mice. Additionally, a negative correlation between Drd2 expression and total ethanol consumption in C. albicans -colonized mice suggested that aversion to ethanol could develop. Therefore, there could be a lack of reinforcement learning, an active aversion, or a combination of both, that leads to lower ethanol preference in C. albicans -colonized mice. Results from the CTA suggest an aversion-dominated phenotype because colonized mice showed a more rapid acquisition of conditioned taste aversion. These findings support the conclusion that aversion to ethanol develops more readily in C. albicans -colonized mice. When conducting other behavioral tests, we found that C. albicans -colonized mice injected with ethanol showed increased LORR onset, decreased locomotion in the open field test (OFT), and further impaired performance on the balance beam. The performance on the balance beam could be restored to mock-colonized performance by EP1/EP2 antagonists. These results suggest that PGE 2 impact on EP1 and EP2 receptors could contribute to motor control following ethanol intoxication. The depressant and sedative effects of ethanol detected in the OFT and LORR tests could be driven by other systems impacted by C. albicans colonization such as the endocannabinoid system (ECS) ( 25 ). Both therapeutic manipulation and gene knockouts of the ECS modulated LORR and OFT phenotypes ( 54 – 56 ). Effects of C. albicans colonization on this pathway ( 25 ) could play a role in these phenotypes. All of the experiments described in this communication were done with ethanol naïve mice. The effects of C. albicans colonization on mice chronically exposed to ethanol are currently unknown. There could be an altered effect of C. albicans -colonization on the host in the setting of AUD and/or chronic stress. Low DRD2 receptor abundance has been shown in individuals with AUD and predisposes mice to stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption ( 57 , 58 ). If DRD2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans with C. albicans colonization, as it is in colonized mice, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress, possibly exacerbating ethanol consumption in AUD. However, our study focused only on initial alcohol consumption and these effects of C. albicans colonization in individuals with AUD and/or chronic stress are currently unstudied. This remains an area of important future research. In summary, we have shown that GI colonization by C. albicans elevates serum PGE 2 and these changes correlate with changes in Ep and Drd receptor expression in the dorsal striatum. C. albicans colonization decreased ethanol consumption and preference in C57BL/6 mice. These decreases in ethanol consumption correlated with changes in dopamine receptor expression and C. albicans -colonized mice showed altered behavioral effects of ethanol. In conclusion, we show for the first time, that changes in the fungal microbiome can impact host ethanol consumption and behavioral responses to ethanol.",
