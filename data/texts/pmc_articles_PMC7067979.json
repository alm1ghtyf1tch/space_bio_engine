    "Abstract": "Abstract The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log 10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.

    "Results": "Microbial Counts on Leaves and Roots VEG-01A was the first time the Veggie facility had been used for plant growth on ISS ( Massa et al., 2017a , b ) so presumably it would have been the least likely of the three plantings described in this study to harbor microbial contamination. Aerobic plate counts for the leaves harvested from VEG-01B flight plants were significantly higher than the counts from both harvests of VEG-03A flight and the ground controls ( P < 0.05) ( Figure 2 ). With the exception of VEG-01B, the flight and ground control aerobic plate counts on leaves were not significantly different. The bacterial counts on ground control samples from VEG-01B were significantly lower than the flight leaves by orders of magnitude ( P < 0.0001) ( Figure 2 ). Previous studies ( Hummerick et al., 2010 , 2012 ) have shown an increase in microbial counts with a repeated harvest or “cut and come again” protocol as was done in VEG-03A. An increase between the 2nd and 4th harvests was not seen in bacterial counts on the leaves, however, fungal counts in the flight leaves were significantly higher in the 4th harvest when compared to the 2nd harvest ( P = 0.0002) ( Figure 3 ). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Mean bacterial (A) and fungal (B) counts on Outredgeous leaves from three Veggie experiments.

Horizontal lines indicate significance between flight samples. ∗ P < 0.05, ∗∗ P < 0.01. Significant differences were determined using an ANOVA with Tukey’s post test to compare groups. The bacterial counts on lettuce leaves grown on ISS in VEG-01A, B and both harvests from VEG-03A were relatively low on average, 3.53, 4.86, 2.89, and 2.14 log 10 CFU/g respectively ( Figure 2 ), when compared to farm or market produce counts of similar type ( Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008 ; Rastogi et al., 2012 ; Jackson et al., 2013 ; Holvoet et al., 2015 ; Wood et al., 2015 ; Hagenmair and Baker, 2016 ; Oyinlola et al., 2017 ; Fröhling et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Fungal counts on Veggie grown lettuce ranging from 2.3 to 4.3 log 10 CFU/g were within the range of yeast and mold counts on lettuce reported in the literature ( Figure 3 ) ( Oliveira et al., 2010 ). Bacterial counts from the roots in the VEG-03A grow out were significantly lower than the other two grow outs and lower than the corresponding ground control ( Figure 3 ) although these counts were in a range of 10 6 -10 8 per gram which is typical of lettuce root tissue ( Riser et al., 1984 ; Adesina et al., 2009 ). Screening for potential food borne pathogens, E. coli, Salmonella sp. , and S. aureus on the leaf tissue yielded negative results. These screening results were corroborated by NGS data. Cultivated Bacterial and Fungal Isolate Identification Cultivation of individual bacterial colony phenotypes on TSA from VEG-01 and VEG-03 samples yielded 14 genera identified from the leaf samples ( Table 2 ) and 19 from the root samples ( Table 3 ). It is important to note that culture based isolation utilized in this study is limited to the selection of the mostly dominant colony phenotypes that grew under aerobic conditions on one type of general growth media. A majority of the bacterial taxa isolated from the Veggie grown leaves are known endophytic and/or epiphytic phyllosphere commensals or symbionts including Arthrobacter ( Scheublin and Leveau, 2013 ), Methylobacterium ( Peredo and Simmons, 2018 ), Sphingomonas ( Kim et al., 1998 ), Pantoea ( Whipps et al., 2008 ), Burkholderia ( Eberl and Vandamme, 2016 ), and Curtobacterium ( Chase et al., 2016 ). Paenibacillus is ubiquitous in soil and is associated with plants predominately as a rhizosphere bacterium exhibiting plant growth promoting characteristics ( Grady et al., 2016 ). A few of the leaf isolates are known to be transients on the surface of the leaf and are not typically part of the normal phyllosphere microbial community including Bacillus and Staphylococcus ( Maduell et al., 2008 ; Dees et al., 2015 ). Human associated bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus were found on the leaves of both flight and ground samples from VEG-03A. These are not natural inhabitants of the plant phyllosphere, however certain strains can be pathogenic to humans and cause food borne illness under optimal growth conditions ( Kadariya et al., 2014 ).

The bacterial genera isolated from the roots ( Table 3 ) are predominately associated with soil and plant phyllosphere and rhizosphere. Ten of the 19 root isolates were also recovered from the leaf samples excluding the four genera Macrococcus, Micrococcus , Staphylococcus , and Sphingomonas . Nine genera of fungi were isolated and identified from leaf tissue ( Table 4 ), while six were recovered from root ( Table 5 ). All the fungal genera present in the roots were also present on the leaves with the exception of Alternaria . The fungi Aspergillus, Penicillium , and Alternaria are ubiquitous, saprophytic fungi often isolated from soil and the environment including ISS surface and air samples ( Royer et al., 2004 ; Venkateswaran et al., 2017 ). Verma et al. (2011) found many of these genera of filamentous fungi as endophytes in the Indian Lily plant root. Among the fungi, the basidiomycete, Rhodotorula was the most common and in fact was isolated from every Veggie sample with the exception of the VEG-03 leaf tissue. TABLE 4.

Community Sequencing Sampling and sequencing of the flight and ground Veggie grown plants were completed on a minimum of two root pillows and up to five leaf samples per grow out. Sequencing profiles for each of the Veggie plantings were used to calculate and investigate the Shannon Species Diversity Index (Alpha Diversity) ( Table 6 ) and establish relative diversity within the bacterial communities in leaf and root and ground and flight samples. Leaf diversity was lower than root in each of the three lettuce crops and there was no significant difference between flight and ground samples ( Table 6 ). Although diversity was similar in all roots or leaves, there appeared to be variation in the dominant genera. TABLE 6.

Plus/minus values are standard deviation determined from three separate sample replicates within each experiment. Alpha diversity in leaf tissue of the three Veggie experiments showed a significant difference between ground and flight leaf samples of VEG-03A only ( P = 0.01). VEG-01A and B flight samples were not significantly different from the respective ground samples. There was also no significant difference in Beta diversity between VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A experiments. Bray Curtis dissimilarity calculations comparing all three experiments were not significantly different between any leaf or root samples of the three tests ( P > 0.05). A majority of the bacterial community sequencing at the phyla level were assigned to phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Comparison at the phyla taxonomic level indicated no significant difference between ground and flight root communities nor in the leaf communities. The dominant phyla for all plants, both ground and flight, was Proteobacteria. VEG-03A flight roots had the lowest percent of the Proteobacteria reads at 59% while the corresponding flight leaf sample was 76% of the total bacterial communities. All other plants from VEG-01A and B ranged from 80 to 96% Proteobacterial reads. However, this disparity was not significantly different. A closer look at the genera contained in the Veggie leaf and root samples showed that Burkholderia, Ralstonia , and Janthinobacterium dominated the Proteobacteria phyla ( Figure 4 ). Other Proteobacteria present in the samples were Azospirillum , and Herbaspirillum , which were detected in higher abundance in VEG-03A as well as Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium , all of which may play a role in nitrogen fixation ( Okubo et al., 2012 ). The dominant genera representing the Chloroflexi was the gram positive, thermophilic, Thermogemmatispora , a soil microbe ( Komaki et al., 2016 ). These microbes were also transported to the leaf but were detected in much lower abundances (percentage), particularly in the flight and ground samples in VEG-03A. Thermogemmatispora was also detected in higher percentages than other microbes but was less than in VEG-03A. The dominant microbe representing the Bacteroidetes, which took second to the Proteobacteria in numerous samples was Chitinophaga. Chitinophaga was higher in abundance of reads in flight sample roots with only VEG-01B showing an elevated abundance in the ground samples ( Figure 4 ). FIGURE 4.

Flight experiments were grown on the ISS while ground controls were grown in Environmental Growth Chambers at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. Bacteria are the top genera obtained from next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. Fungal communities from VEG-01A and VEG-01B were surveyed and it was determined that the Ascomycota phyla dominated both flight and ground communities as well as leaf and root communities (92–99%). Few Basidiomycota were detectable. VEG-01A flight roots presented the highest representation at 7% with VEG-01B flight root community containing 6%. All other communities contained 2% or less of total fungi detected ( Figure 5 ). FIGURE 5. Open in a new tab Fungal community for lettuce leaf (A) and root (B) tissue for VEG-01A and VEG-01B experiments. Flight experiments were grown on the ISS while ground controls were grown in Environmental Growth Chambers at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. Fungi are the top genera obtained from next generation sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. Fungal diversity in the root samples for both flight and ground was significantly higher than leaf – an expected outcome ( P < 0.05). Among the dominating genera in flight and ground leaf samples was Microidium , an obligate biotroph ( Braun and Cook, 2012 ; Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017 ). Leaf samples also housed Alternaria , Fusarium (VEG-01B only), and Malassezia , a yeast like fungi. Root samples from all three growth tests had increased levels of Alternaria, Phaeoacremonium , and Rhodosporidiobolus ( Figure 5 ). Alternaria was found in all samples with the exception of VEG-01A leaf tissue while Phaeoacremonium was present in increased abundance in VEG-01A root and in reduced numbers in VEG-01A leaf tissue ( Figure 5 ). Comparison of culturable and non-culturable microbes in all samples provided corroborating evidence in that all culturable microbes were identified in the sequencing data. However, sequencing data revealed many additional genera present, increasing the species diversity. Elemental Analysis Leaf tissue from flight and ground experiments were analyzed for changes in elemental composition ( Table 7 ). There was no significant differences between ground and flight samples within each experiment, however when comparing among all three experiments, Fe and K content were significantly lower in VEG-03A samples compared to VEG-01A and VEG-01B (Fe, P ≤ 0.001; K, P ≤ 0.0001). On the other hand, Na content was found to be significantly higher in VEG-01B compared to VEG-01A or VEG-03A ( P ≤ 0.0001). Phosphate (P) measured among all three experiments showed that VEG-01B had higher P contents than VEG-01A and VEG-03A ( P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, sulfate measured as S and Zn contents were statistically higher in VEG-01B compared to either VEG-01A or VEG-03A (S, P ≤ 0.05; Zn, P ≤ 0.0001). No significant differences were observed in either Ca, Mg, or Mn content. TABLE 7. Elemental content of lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A ground and flight samples.

Total Phenolics, Anthocyanins and ORAC Analysis As a measure of antioxidant capacity, total phenolics, anthocyanins and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) were measured on lettuce leaf tissue, flight and ground samples from all three tests ( Table 8 ). Comparing total phenolics, VEG-03A with 15.0 (ground) and 19.6 (flight) mg/g of dry weight (gallic acid equivalents) had the statistically lowest amounts when compared to either VEG-01A or VEG-01B ( P ≤ 0.001). Anthocyanins measured as cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents showed no difference among all three experiments compared. Similarly, ORAC units measured among all three experiments did not exhibit any observable variance. TABLE 8.

    "Conclusion": "Differences in culturable bacterial and fungal density on the leaves in each of the Veggie plantings can not necessarily be traced to a particular source or environmental condition. However, it is reasonable to conclude that environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, water levels provided, the microbiota in the air on ISS, and possible human interaction at the time of growth and harvest may contribute to the microbial community and density on the surface of the leaves. Terrestrially, airborne bacteria and fungal spores can land on the surface of leaves and become a part of the epiphytic microbial community albeit transient and dynamic depending on selective pressures ( Lindow and Brandl, 2003 ; Vokou et al., 2012 ; Maignien et al., 2014 ). Varying conditions such as humidity, leaf surface moisture and temperature can also effect the colonization and growth of bacteria and fungi on leaf surfaces. There is a positive correlation between fungal sporulation and the duration of leaf surface moisture ( Talley et al., 2002 ; Li et al., 2014 ). Poor air circulation can cause persistent droplets of moisture on the surface of a leaf due to transpiration producing a micro environment favorable for microbial proliferation. In the case of the three Veggie plantings on the ISS, environmental data collected by HOBO data recorders ( Supplementary Table S1 ) showed that temperature and humidity were slightly higher inside the Veggie chamber during the first 22 days of VEG-03A growth than the other two Veggie tests. Additionally, germinating seedlings in the VEG-03A test had excess moisture in the early period of growth, likely due to a fan malfunction, when compared to the VEG-01A and VEG-01B plants. It was during this experiment that our team identified a consistent anomaly with the Veggie hardware – specifically that when power is cycled to the hardware, upon restarting the fan will read “low” but it will actually be off. This problem also led to issues of excess moisture in an earlier Zinnia test but a repetition of this with lettuce confirmed the anomaly. In contrast, VEG-01A and VEG-01B tests had no fan issues, but instead the plants had some periods of low water early on (see Massa et al., 2017a ). Given that Veggie is a manually watered system and that fluid behavior in microgravity differs considerably from that on Earth, these early Veggie experiments involved considerable variation in fluid addition as both the ground teams and the astronauts struggled to effectively water the crops. Logged data from VEG-03A were not collected for the duration of the 64 days experiment so it is speculative to conclude any correlation between microbial counts and Veggie chamber conditions. Key to this work is determining the microbiological food safety of Veggie grown crops. Bacterial and fungal counts on fresh plant material are not necessarily an indication of the food quality and microbiological safety of the item and vary depending on the type of plant ( Leff and Fierer, 2013 ; Qadri et al., 2015 ). Studies show that leafy greens grown in the field or greenhouse have a range of approximately 4–8 log 10 CFU bacterial counts per gram of sample while yeast and mold counts on lettuce are reported in the range of 2–5 log 10 ( Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008 ; Rastogi et al., 2012 ; Jackson et al., 2013 ; Holvoet et al., 2015 ; Wood et al., 2015 ; Hagenmair and Baker, 2016 ; Oyinlola et al., 2017 ; Fröhling et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). The microbial counts on lettuce leaves grown on ISS in VEG-01A, B and both harvests from VEG-03A were relatively low on average when compared to farm or market produce counts of similar type. In addition, none of the target human pathogens were detected in culture based testing and 16S community sequencing. These results demonstrate that from a microbiological perspective the Outredgeous variety of lettuce grown in Veggie was safe for human consumption. Microbiological data collected from lettuce and reported in the literature provides evidence that different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities ( Ibekwe and Grieve, 2004 ; Toju et al., 2019 ). While our culture based isolation of bacteria recovered a few species unique to leaves many of the isolates present on the phyllosphere were also present in the roots. Previous work on the relationship of the phyllosphere bacterial community and airborne bacteria by Vokou et al. (2012) demonstrated that colonization of the phyllosphere is not always related to the aerial microbial community within the plants proximity and may include commensal and symbiotic taxa as well as environmentally indigenous transients. Staphylococcus has been isolated on the ISS on both surfaces and in the air ( Venkateswaran et al., 2014 , 2017 ) so it is not unlikely that plants in Veggie chambers would be exposed to these types of bacteria. Microbiological surveys done on a variety of surfaces and materials on the ISS reported many of the same bacteria and fungi that we isolated from plant material grown in Veggie. We compared bacterial and fungal isolates from this study of Veggie grown plants with isolates described in a study by Venkateswaran et al. (2017) which characterized the microbiology of ISS surfaces. More than 50% of the genera of bacteria and 100% of the fungi isolated and identified on ISS surfaces were also isolated from Veggie samples. NASA reported monitoring results of space station samples including air surfaces and water from 1998 to 2012 using cultivation methods ( Castro et al., 2004 ; Yamaguchi et al., 2014 ). In these studies, the two most commonly isolated genera from water samples collected between 2009 and 2012 were Burkholderia sp. and Ralstonia sp. These are persistent and common in station potable water as well as terrestrial water sources and have been isolated and identified from Space Shuttle potable water ( Koenig and Pierson, 1997 ; Ryan et al., 2007 ) so it is not unexpected that these were also isolated in the roots and leaves of both flight and ground control plants. Plants, regardless of growth conditions, harbor an indigenous population that may affect plant health and, if utilized as a food source, human health. One of the important findings in this study is the similarity and densities in the dominant leaf and root microbial community members as those reported in the literature grown under very different conditions ( Dees et al., 2015 ). Culturable microbes include approximately 10% of the community microbial participants. Research on core rhizosphere and phyllosphere associated bacterial microbiota (symbiotic and pathogenic) have been described using culture-independent sequencing methods ( Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019 ). Next generation sequencing provides an alternative method to identify non-culturable microorganisms. It is important to identify these organisms as it may provide insight into the safety and health quality of the plants/crops being harvested and consumed. Each of the bacterial and fungal isolates identified in this study were confirmed with sequencing results, however, many additional genera were identified. Research studies indicate Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria phyla dominate communities, though differences may occur between host plant species at lower taxonomic levels ( Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019 ). Sequencing data from the three Veggie experiments followed these trends. Lettuce leaf tissue in all three Veggie experiments was dominated with Thermogemmatispora , a gram positive, sporulating, soil organism that has been known to produce secondary metabolites provided to plants as a secondary resource ( Komaki et al., 2016 ). Thermogemmatispora has been found in lettuce seeds in high abundance but was reduced in root and leaf tissues (unpublished data, Khodadad et al). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium are also commonly found in soils as they may participate in nitrogen fixation ( Okubo et al., 2012 ). Bradyrhizobium has also been noted in higher abundance in low nutrient soils ( Okubo et al., 2012 ). Both microbes were present in higher abundance in flight root samples and were low or undetectable in leaf tissue with the highest abundance in VEG-03A roots. VEG-03A was grown for longer periods of time and may have depleted the nutrient levels in the substrate. In addition, microbes commonly associated with water were also detected in both leaf and root tissue. These microbes mentioned previously include Ralstonia , Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Cupriavidus , and Pseudomonas were identified in all leaf and root samples of all three Veggie experiments. These have been identified as present on ISS as well as in the ISS water system ( Castro et al., 2004 ; Checinska et al., 2015 ; Venkateswaran et al., 2017 ). It is important to note that several of the microbes identified may be potential endosymbionts with plants or fungi and be present as epiphytic or endophytic organisms. One example is Chitinophaga , found in all flight and ground root samples. Though it is unknown what the function of this bacteria may have been within these Veggie communities, it has been found to interact with fungal species present in plants by enhancing nutrient uptake and growth, altering plant water interactions or deterring potential pathogens ( Shaffer et al., 2017 ). These interactions have the capability of shaping plant health and productivity by accessing and making additional carbon sources available ( Kivlin et al., 2011 ; Shaffer et al., 2017 ). To determine their role and benefit to plants or fungi would require additional flight and ground studies. As fungi were present in each flight and ground sample community, it is important to note those in abundance and their persistence over time. Fungi have been detected on the ISS in various locations ( Venkateswaran et al., 2014 , 2017 ). Leaf and root systems of VEG-01A and B were surveyed for the presence of fungi and compared. Alternaria, Microidium , and Phaeoacremonium were the top three fungal genera identified with sequencing. Alternaria , an Ascomycota, has been described as a saprophyte that may decompose organic matter, and increase in communities with high humidity ( Patriarca, 2016 ). They may also associate with other fungal genera such as Fusarium or Stachybotrys . Though neither of these fungal genera were identified in VEG-01A, both were first detected in VEG-01B samples with higher incidence in ground samples therefore, they may have been introduced as a contaminant. Phaeoacremonium is a plant associated endophyte previously associated with lettuce and woody plants ( Mostert et al., 2005 ) while Microidium may be an opportunistic plant pathogen especially in high humidity environments ( Braun and Cook, 2012 ; Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017 ). Plants require macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, B, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo) for their growth and development ( Epstein, 1972 ). These elements are essential and play critical roles in multiple plant processes. Comparing all three experiments, VEG-01B had higher elemental contents for Na, P, S, and Zn, whereas VEG-03A had the lowest amounts for Fe and K. Considering the chronological order of the experiments onboard the ISS, VEG-01B was grown a year later than VEG-01A, which raises the possibility of a change in the ISS water, but that may not be the only variable as plants grown in microgravity experience stresses from environmental conditions, so it would be impractical to draw any conclusions from these differences. VEG-03A, which was grown 1.5 years after the VEG-01B, was the sequential harvest experiment. As described in section “Materials and Methods,” there were four repeated harvests (38, 45, 59, and 64 days after initiation) of this experiment and only two (day 45 and day 64) were returned to earth. Romaine lettuce in field settings can take 75 days to fully mature, however, controlled environment growth is generally faster. By the final harvest photos indicated that some of the plants seemed to be transitioning to a reproductive growth phase, so it is possible that stresses from space flight may have pushed the plants to initiate senescence and that could provide a possible explanation for slightly lower elemental levels of some elements in VEG-03A samples ( Maillard et al., 2015 ). Similarly, differences in the levels of total phenolics among VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A samples could be attributed to the environmental conditions. There have been known challenges associated with irrigation of plants in the Veggie hardware and VEG-01 showed evidence of insufficient and excess (in case of zinnia, VEG-01C) water in the root zone ( Massa et al., 2017a ). Studies have shown that either insufficient watering (drought-like, Sarker and Oba, 2018 ) or over-watering leading to hypoxia ( Rajapakse et al., 2009 ) can induce production of phenolic compounds and free-radical scavenging activities. Again, there are not enough data to make any conclusions about the effects of the sequential harvesting method on plant ionome or phenolic content and more robust experiments are needed. Numerous Veggie tests have been conducted on the ISS, the plant growth evaluated, and in some cases the leaves consumed. Three plantings of red romaine lettuce were considered here (VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A). Through culturable and non-culturable methods of microbial analysis, the Veggie tests demonstrated diverse microbial communities with no potential human pathogens detected and therefore could provide a safe supplement to the astronauts’ diet. Chemical analysis provided evidence of significant changes in elemental and antioxidant content which may be an important factor to consider for nutritional value in future, long duration, exploration missions.",
