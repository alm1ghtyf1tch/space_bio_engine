    "Results": "Combined antagomir inhibition is effective in counteracting space radiation damage We investigated the cellular alterations associated with the protective roles of three antagomirs targeting miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p in a 3D human microvasculature model. Firstly, we examined the effect of individual miRNAs to mitigate structural damage caused by space radiation exposure from simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). The morphology of mature microvessels representing post-mitotic cells with characteristics of the endothelial barrier (tight junctions) was preserved by inhibiting any of the three key miRNAs (Fig. 1a, c ). A single dose of each individual antagomir 24 h before GCR irradiation was sufficient to protect microvessels although the combination of the three was more effective. Furthermore, the inhibition by each miRNA was comparable to the unirradiated controls. Fig. 1. Antagomir treatment of 3D human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) microvessel cell cultures. Open in a new tab a , b Quantification of formation of microvessels using 3D cultures of human microvessels irradiated with 0.5 Gy of simplified simulated galactic cosmic rays (GCR) compared to sham irradiated samples. Irradiated cultures were treated with or without antagomir-induced inhibition of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and/or let-7a-5p.

The p-values were determined by two-side multiple pairwise comparison. c Mature and angiogenesis microvessels fixed and fluorescently stained with 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl) aminofluorescein (DTAF) after GCR irradiation, with or without antagomirs 24 h prior to irradiation. Scale bar = 100 µm. For mature the following biological independent samples were used: n = 17 for 0 Gy, n = 18 for 0.5 Gy, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + 3 antagomirs, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + let-7a-5p antagomir, n = 17 for 0.5 Gy + miR-16-5p antagomir, and n = 16 for 0.5 Gy + miR-125b-5p antagomir. For angiogenesis the following biological independent samples were performed: n = 18 for 0 Gy, n = 20 for 0.5 Gy, n = 14 for 0.5 Gy + 3 antagomirs, n = 11 for 0.5 Gy + let-7a-5p antagomir, n = 14 for 0.5 Gy + miR-16-5p antagomir, and n = 10 for 0.5 Gy + miR-125b-5p antagomir. A similar result was found for the longer multistage development of microvessels undergoing angiogenesis. In this model, cells were exposed to GCR on culture day 1, when they were still individual and not connected; while the irradiation effects were seen on day 6, when the endothelial cells should have been formed into mature microvessels (Fig. 1b, c ). Individual antagomirs applied on days 2 and 3 restore angiogenesis at levels comparable to controls, and combined antagomirs exert an improved protective role (Fig. 1b ). In both models, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p are similarly effective at counteracting the effects of space radiation, but the antagomir combination inhibition of the three miRNAs provides a stronger and more robust response. Hereafter, we focus on the biological changes occurring when inhibiting all three miRNAs. Combined antagomir inhibition protects microvessels from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by space radiation While the biological consequences of GCR exposure on mature and developing microvessels are clearly observed 24 h and 7 days after irradiation, respectively, examination of earlier endpoints would enable us to understand the impact of antagomir treatment. Since DNA is the primary target damaged by radiation, early effects from miRNA inhibition on DNA damage and repair were investigated. As the repair of DNA DSB damage by space radiation is pivotal for cellular function, we assessed the cellular proteins involved in DNA DSB repair targeted by miRNA inhibition. Many of the DNA DSB repair genes are common targets of the miRNAs as shown by a network representation for the perturbation effects of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a-5p (Fig. 2a ). These results suggest that miRNAs play an important role in activating the DNA DSB repair pathways induced by GCR irradiation. Fig. 2. Quantification of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair foci with antagomir treatment and miRNA pathway analysis.

To determine the molecular mechanism through which the antagomirs protect mature and developing microvessels from the effects of GCR, we studied the accumulation of DNA DSBs and the activation of DNA repair pathways. Immunocytochemical staining for the tumor suppressor p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) was quantified following antagomir treatment 90 min after GCR irradiation (Fig. 2b ). The 53BP1 protein accumulates at the site DNA DSBs after irradiation, and the resulting repair foci can be measured as a critical platform for DNA DSB repair activity 20 . The peak DNA repair foci often occurs around 30 min after gamma irradiation and our previous publications showed that foci induced by charged particles decline over several hours in the human microvasculature model 21 . Our current analysis shows a significant increase in DNA DSB repair foci (Fig. 2b ). In contrast, the antagomir treatment significantly decreased the number of foci to levels similar to the unirradiated condition. This demonstrates that the antagomirs protect microvasculature cells from DNA DSBs caused by space radiation at much earlier times due to potentially providing a more efficient DNA repair mechanism. The changes in expression of miRNAs after GCR exposure and its relationship to DNA repair mechanisms is not widely understood 22 . To determine if DNA DSBs are associated with a global response from those evolutionarily conserved miRNAs that we observed in vivo, we exposed C57BL/6 female mice to 0.5 Gy of GCR and performed miRNA-sequencing on the plasma, liver, soleus muscle, and heart (Fig. 2c, d ). From pathway analysis 23 of DNA DSB and repair pathways, we observed a comprehensive increase in DNA DSB genesets across all four tissues from the measured changes in miRNA expression. The global increase associated with overall miRNA activity following GCR irradiation further supports the key roles of these miRNAs in the DNA DSB repair pathways. Space radiation reveals key regulation of the three miRNAs in specific tissues To further establish miRNA changes after space radiation and the importance of miR-16, miR-125b, and let-7a with cardiovascular health risks, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the miRNA-seq data from the mice exposed to 0.5 Gy of GCR (Fig. 3 ) 24 . WGCNA classically was designed for transcriptomic RNA-seq data, but recently has proven its utility in miRNA-seq data 25 , 26 . Hence, we utilized WGCNA to determine key miRNA networks that are impacted by space radiation and how they are affected in the heart, liver, soleus muscle, and plasma of mice. The WGCNA analysis revealed three distinct miRNA networks (i.e., “Modules” or “ME”) that are most strongly impacted by GCR radiation, depending on the tissue type (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 3a–c ). Interestingly, for all three Modules the heart tissue showed the most significant decrease comparing GCR irradiated mice to sham (Fig. 3a–c ). For Module 0 (Figs. 3a ) and 2 (Fig. 3c ), the liver shows a significant increase. When observing the key miRNAs involved in each module we see that let-7a-5p is present in Module 0 (Fig. 3d ), miR-16-5p in Module 1 (Fig. 3e ), and miR-15b-5p in Module 2 (Fig. 3f ). The individual miRNAs within each Module were differential expressed due to GCR radiation (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Fig. 3.

Rescue of space radiation damage with inhibition of key miRNAs associated with cardiovascular space radiation damage Based on our intriguing results showing complete protection of the 3D human microvessel cell cultures post GCR irradiation by the inhibition of three miRNAs, we further investigated the key biological processes involved. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on the mature microvessel and angiogenesis models after 0.5 Gy of GCR exposure and compared conditions with or without the combination of antagomirs (Fig. 4 ). The experimental design for the antagomir treatment is depicted in Fig. 4a . The antagomir treatment and endpoints after irradiation differ between the two models as described in Malkani et al. 13 for the mature microvessel model and Wuu et al. 15 for the angiogenesis model.

For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p -value. The adj. p-value plots are also provided in Supplementary Fig. 3 . Global transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq results revealed key patterns associated to antagomir treatment after GCR irradiation. Overall, antagomir treated samples post-irradiation clustered closer to the sham unirradiated samples for both microvessel cell cultures (Fig. 4b ). This indicates that the antagomir treatment had a substantial impact on restoring gene expression back to normal levels. Of note, we are utilizing p -value statistics for our main analysis and acknowledge that this may result in the potential of more false positives, but we believe that the information generated by lowering the statistical significance will produce more meaningful data and previous literature also provided further justification when necessary to utilize p -values 27 , 28 . In addition, we have also provided the adj. p -value analysis for full transparency of our results (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Although the global clustering of both models demonstrates a restoration closer to the basal levels, there are measurable differences between the two models with GCR irradiation alone and GCR with the antagomirs. This is apparent when observing the transcriptomic patterns for the significantly regulated genes (Fig. 4c ). GCR irradiation caused a greater number of genes to be differentially regulated for the mature vessel compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 4d , e). Antagomir treatment during irradiation in mature (before) or in angiogenesis cells (after) caused significant dysregulation in both models (Fig. 4d, e ). Substantially more genes were uniquely altered in the angiogenesis compared to the mature microvessel model (Fig. 4f ), as may be expected since the endpoint is much longer than in the mature microvessel model and encompasses multiple stages of development. We also identified a set of orphan genes to be differentially regulated in GCR-stressed samples and reversed by antagomir treatment. Orphan genes code for proteins that are unique to a species 29 – 31 and may provide a major source of evolutionary novelty conferring beneficial traits to a species. Evidence-based (EB) orphan genes were identified by Singh 32 based on a comprehensive analysis of 27,000 RNA-Seq datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project. To determine how human orphan genes respond to space radiation and antagomir treatment, differential expression of orphan genes was assessed in the RNA-seq data. In both models, tens of orphan genes were differentially expressed by space irradiation plus antagomirs, but not with radiation alone (Fig. 4c, d , and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Since orphan genes often integrate themselves into metabolic and regulatory networks 31 , 33 , 34 , these could play a role in the dysregulation of DNA repair and metabolic pathways associated with response to space radiation and antagomir treatment observed here. To better identify dysregulated genes targeted by the antagomirs, we used miRNA target analysis by the mirDIP algorithm 35 to assess transcripts downregulated by irradiation but restored after antagomir treatment. Twenty-one gene targets, including PDPR , APAF1 , XPO6 , NIBAN1 , and SLC7A1 , were predicted to be simultaneous targets of each miRNA (Fig. 5a ). To validate the key genes, we performed PCR on 8 of the 21 genes from the same isolated RNA utilized for the RNA-seq (Fig. 5b ). We see that all the genes are in agreement with the RNA-seq data except for MSH5 , which we see an upregulation with 0.5 Gy and then the expression returns back to 0 Gy levels after antagomir treatment. We investigated how well the miRNAs bound to the 21 gene targets (“antagomir-rescued genes”), and the log 2 fold change from the RNA-seq data after GCR exposure. We observed that the three miRNAs bound to the 3’-UTR and CDS regions of 15 (Fig. 5c ) and 13 (Fig. 5d ) out of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes, respectively, whereas let-7a-5p and miR-125b-5p bound only to two of the target genes (Fig. 5e ).

The experimental evidence for the targets have been compiled from TarBase, miRTarBase, starBase, and literature. We have also provided the details for the experimental evidence from these databases in Supplementary Table 1 . The *mirDIP gene targets for each miRNA as shown in panel a . It is important to note that the databases provide literature references for all the experimental evidence and the literature indication in the figure is for additional literature evidence outside of these databases. j Radar plot illustrating homology of pre-miRNAs (red) and mature miRNAs (black) in humans and mice for miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p. To survey the efficacy of the three miRNAs to downregulate the 21 gene targets, we analyzed RNA-seq fold change values from different experimental conditions using cumulative plots 36 see Methods). Figure 5f shows that the 21 antagomir-rescued genes with 7-8mer 3’-UTR sites had a significant propensity to be downregulated compared to those without 3’-UTR sites ( P = 4.99e−07, 2.65e−32 and 6.31e−09 for 8mer, 7mer-m8 and 7mer-A1, respectively, using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). These results indicate that miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p play a key role in the downregulation of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes. Figure 5g, h shows that the downregulation of these genes is drastically reduced under antagomir treatment, indicating that by inhibiting these 3 miRNAs, expression of these genes reverts towards the control (0 Gy) levels. Pathway analysis of the antagomir-restored transcripts targeted by one or more of the three miRNA shows an enrichment pattern for expression of genes associated with apoptosis and TP53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Thus, alteration of these pathways may account for the observed preservation of the 3D microvessels by antagomir treatment with GCR exposure. To confirm that these 21 genes are actual targets for the three miRNAs we dissected the pathways involved with the mirDIP algorithm analysis and also provided experimental evidence from current databases and literature. While mirDIP draws from a comprehensive pool of 24 databases to evaluate miRNA targets 35 , our focus was on the analysis of the six most reputable databases among them (Fig. 5i ). Additionally, we corroborated the experimental validation of these gene targets by cross-referencing data from three databases (i.e. miRTarBase 37 , TarBase 38 , and starBase 39 ) alongside pertinent literature references (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Table 1 ). Our results indicate robust experimental validation of gene targets for the three miRNAs as follows: 10 out of 10 for miR-16-5p, 13 out of 14 for let-7a-5p, and 9 out of 15 for miR-125b-5p. It’s worth noting that while the validation rate for miR-125b-5p stands at 60% based on these databases, certain contextual conditions may influence the validation of gene targets for miRNAs. Nevertheless, our additional experimental evidence (Fig. 5 b–h) enhances the confidence in our findings. Finally, it is crucial to assess the conservation of these three miRNAs between humans and mice. It is well-established that miRNAs exhibit high levels of conservation across species, particularly between mice and humans 40 . Our analysis demonstrates 100% conservation of all three mature miRNAs (i.e. miR-16-5p, miR-125p-5p, and let-7a-5p) and their precursor forms have conservation rates greater than 95% between mouse and human genomes (Fig. 5j ). Given the robust conservation observed, comparisons between results obtained in mouse and human contexts can be easily facilitated. Regulation of antagomir-rescued genes in astronauts The relevance to humans of the 21 genes that are rescued by the antagomir countermeasures in the 3D human tissues (Fig. 6a ) were further examined using data from the NASA Twin Study 17 (REF) (Fig. 6a–d ), Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study 18 of astronauts that were in space for 120 days (Fig. 6e, f ), as well as data from the first civilian commercial 3-day spaceflight mission, referred to as Inspiration4 (I4) 19 (Fig. 6g–s ). The NASA Twin Study has been described in several papers which compared two identical twins with one Twin on the ISS for 340 days and the other twin on Earth 12 , 17 . The JAXA study conducted RNA-seq on plasma cell-free RNAs from six astronauts who were on the International Space Station (ISS) for 120 days, sampled from pre-flight, during flight, and post-flight time points. The I4 mission performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on the blood and also RNA-seq skin biopsies which involved 4 astronauts (two males and two females) that orbited at low Earth orbit (LEO) at 590 km above the atmosphere (Fig. 6f ). The I4 mission occurred at a much higher altitude than the ISS, thus the I4 astronauts experienced a higher accumulated dose of radiation compared to being on the ISS. It is important to note that the estimated accumulated doses of space radiation that the astronauts were exposed to for these missions were lower than 0.5 Gy (which is the estimated dose for a trip to Mars and back), but despite this we still observed key changes as we will describe below. The following are the accumulated doses that were measured for each mission: NASA Twin Study astronaut received 146.34 mSv or 14.634 cGy 17 , I4 astronauts received 4.72 mSv or 0.472 cGy 19 , and for the JAXA astronauts we estimated that they had received an accumulated dose of 51.60 mSv or 5.16 cGy (the dosimetry was not reported for this mission and this is an estimate based on the average dose received per month from other missions) 18 .

The values shown are the averaged normalized expression values for all six astronauts for each time point during flight and post-flight. The three pre-flight time points were averaged together, since the changes for genes in the time leading up to flight are considered to be the same and part of the baseline values. For the time, L = Launch (i.e. meaning time after launch from Earth and length in space) and R = Return to Earth. f A schematic of the i4 experimental design created with BioRender.com released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International license.

Using RNA-seq data from the NASA Twin Study, we analyzed the expression of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes over four different circulating cell populations with the Twin onboard the ISS for 340 days: CD4 T cells (Fig. 6a ), CD8 T cells (Fig. 6b ), CD19 B cells (Fig. 6c ), and a lymphocyte depleted cell population which will represent the monocytes (Fig. 6d ). There are individual gene variations observed from preflight to the last time point after return (i.e. R + 200 days), but the overall gene signature changes will indicate how these genes will be impacted by the three miRNAs. The global changes for these 21 genes over time is best observed with cumulative plots for the different cell types for the Twin in space over time (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Fig. 7a ). It was observed that the only cell type to show significant changes for the 21 genes from flight to return on Earth were the lymphocyte depleted cells or monocytes (Fig. 7a ). We show that for flight vs pre-flight and R + 1 vs pre-flight (i.e. immediately after return to Earth) there was significant downregulation for these key genes and then at 34 days and beyond, the genes have returned back to the control pre-flight expression. Fig. 7. The interaction of the three miRNAs with the 21 gene targets from the NASA Twin Study in Monocytes. Open in a new tab a Cumulative plots for change over time with the 21 genes targeted by the three miRNAs using RNA-seq data from the NASA Twin Study data. Sequencing was performed on lymphocyte depleted cells (i.e. monocytes) from the Twin that was onboard the ISS for 340 days. There are comparisons over time starting with Flight versus Pre-Flight as well as comparing the different Return (R) to Earth timepoints from 1 to 200 days versus Pre-Flight. b Correlation plot of the three miRNAs (i.e. miR-16-5p, let-7a-5p, and miR-125b-5p) and the 21 gene targets for the overlapping time points from the miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq NASA Twin Study data. The gene targets for the miRNAs are indicated in the outer black (yes for gene target) and gray (no for gene target) rows and columns. Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p -value and significance for the correlation is shown by * p -value < 0.05. To establish the direct relationship between the 21 gene targets and the three miRNAs, we utilized the NASA Twin Study which had both miRNA- and mRNA-seq data associated with the mission and cell types. Similar to the cumulative plots, we observed the correlation between the three miRNAs (i.e. miR-16, let-7a, and miR-125b) with the 21 gene targets in the four different cell types (i.e. CD4, CD8, CD19, and monocytes) (Supplementary Fig. 7b ). We correlated with the overlapping time points per each sample type and observed for the majority of the miRNAs and genes targets an inverse relationship. Specifically, for monocytes for the specific gene targets the miRNAs had an inverse correlation (Fig. 7b ). Since the miRNAs will traditionally silence the specific gene target, this result is what we would expect and provides further validation in astronauts that these miRNAs in circulation will be ideal targets to reduce health risks as our in vitro results show. We noticed that most of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes in the JAXA data were downregulated during the flight, indicating that increased activity of the let-7a-5p, mir-125b-5p, and mir-16-5p might cause the suppression of these target genes in astronauts (Fig. 6e ). Most of the genes show up-regulation post-flight as compared to pre-flight and during flight (Fig. 6e ). This is consistent with the i4 data, in which antagomir-rescued gene activity is significantly increased post-flight compared to the pre-flight in most of the cell types sampled from the astronauts (Fig. 6c ). The ratio of up-regulation in these selected 21 antagomir-rescued genes is more significant than the average up-regulation ratio of all genes (Fig. 6 c, d), suggesting that this subset is more susceptible to expression change due to the space environment. Cell-dependent differences are detectable for specific genes during spaceflight for the I4 astronauts data (Fig. 6e–n and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Two genes, ARL6IP6 (ADP Ribosylation Factor Like GTPase 6 Interacting Protein 6) and TSEN15 (TRNA Splicing Endonuclease Subunit 15), are significantly up-regulated post-flight compared to pre-flight in eight of the ten cell types, with CD16+ cells and dendritic cells (DCs) not significantly different for ARL6IP6 and CD14+ cells, and DCs not significantly different for TSEN15 . ARL6IP6 is involved in ischemic strokes in patients 41 , which could have implications related to microvessel damage in space. In murine stem cells, ARL6IP6 exhibits properties of regulating nuclear envelope structure, interacting with proteins involved in nuclear envelope resealing and repair 42 . TSEN15 is involved in tRNA splicing and intron removal fundamental processes for cell growth and division 43 . It has been implicated in hypoplasia (the impairment in development of tissues and organs due to the decrease in cell number) 44 . Specifically, TSEN15 has been shown to cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and progressive microcephaly. Although this occurs at an early stage of life ( i.e . infants), one could speculate that TSEN15 may play important roles in cell proliferation in adults. Interestingly, TSEN15 has also been associated with autoinflammatory neurodegenerative diseases 45 . ARL6IP6 ( ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6 interacting protein 6) is predicted to be targeted by miR-125b-5p and let-7a-5p and TSEN15 is predicted to be targeted by miR-16-5p and let-7a-5 (Fig. 5 ). Skin biopsies from the i4 astronauts were also used for RNA-seq comparing post-flight to pre-flight (Fig. 6s ) with four different skin regions in the analysis: Outer Epidermis (OE), Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA). The VA compartment is closely related to the 3D microvessel cell models which seems to produce the strongest regulation of the 21 key genes. ARL6IP6 is upregulated in the VA for post-flight compared to pre-flight similar to what is observed in the blood (Fig. 6 i–r), while TSEN15 is downregulated. Interestingly, 57%, 52%, and 52% of the 21 genes were downregulated for the OE, IE, and VA regions, while for the OD region only 38% were downregulated. Overall, for all the astronaut data, the measured changes of these genes from ex vivo cellular samples may suggest that an interventional treatment with the three antagomirs might lead to improved astronaut health. Major cellular pathways altered by radiation exposure and rescued by antagomir treatment To determine the key pathways that are altered by radiation with or without antagomir treatment, we performed pathway analysis on the bulk RNA-seq data via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Using the Hallmark database 46 , general pathway enrichments were more pronounced in the mature microvessels compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 8a, b ). Radiation exposure in both these models triggered positive enrichment of pathways typically observed from this treatment such as TP53, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-alpha signaling. For both the mature microvessel and angiogenesis cellular models, there was a significantly decreased enrichment associated with the mitotic spindle due to radiation exposure that was reversed by the antagomir treatment. This is consistent with the fact that cellular death following radiation exposure may occur through mitotic catastrophe due to failure of mitotic spindle checkpoints 47 . Fig. 8.

Only significantly regulated pathways with FDR < 0.05 are shown. The nominal enrichment score (NES) represents the relative degree a gene set is changed and is corrected for gene set size. An increase in inflammatory-related genes and pathways after irradiation is a common occurrence driving the late effects of radiation injury 48 , 49 . Radiation exposure with antagomir treatment caused a significant reversal in enrichment for several of these pathways. Strikingly, in both mature and angiogenesis microvessels, pathways for an inflammatory response, TNF-alpha signaling, interferon responses, and IL-6 are significantly decreased by the addition of antagomirs (Fig. 8a, b ). Pathways for hypoxia, DNA repair, and oxidative phosphorylation are also activated with the GCR treatment while the antagomir treatment inhibits these pathways. The antagomirs also restored the suppression associated with cell cycle observed with space radiation for the angiogenesis model (Fig. 7b ). As a result, the antagomirs appear to be regulating key pathways in the radiation response that may be essential in assisting repair of the damage caused by space radiation in the mature microvasculature. To further explore the consequences of antagomir treatment to radiation exposure, Reactome genesets consisting of 26 super pathways were examined (Fig. 8c, d ). Positively or negatively enriched genesets in the same direction by irradiation with or without antagomirs were excluded. The remaining genesets have opposing enrichments or are enriched by only one treatment. These pathways may represent critical targets that provide beneficial effects from antagomir treatment. Genes involved in DNA repair by Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) are enriched in mature microvessels after radiation exposure (Fig. 8c ). However, adding antagomirs suppresses these changes as well as changes in genes linked to DNA damage bypass via translation synthesis. This was accompanied by a decrease in pathways involved in cellular stress [e.g. genesets for heme oxygenase 1, hypoxia, detoxification of ROS, EIF2AK4 (GCN2) amino acid deficiencies] as well as a decrease in cell cycle control including telomere maintenance. Notably, there was an overall increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization with the irradiation and antagomirs that was not statistically significant with radiation alone. Earlier during the angiogenesis phase of the microvessels, irradiation overwhelmingly decreased cell cycle genesets while the addition of the antagomirs abolished this statistically significant manifestation (Fig. 8d ). DNA replication as well as DNA DSB repair by homologous recombination was also returned to non-significant control levels by antagomir treatment. DNA damage, inflammation, stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are normally associated with the induction of cellular senescence 48 . Therefore, we used publicly available databases compiling markers of cellular senescence 50 , 51 to investigate whether GCR caused senescence and the antagomirs protected the 3D human microvasculature model from it. Curiously, most senescence pathways were suppressed by GCR, except for oncogene-induced senescence (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). This is consistent with upregulation of TP53 target genes, although it dissociates oncogene induction from other causes of senescence induction. The antagomirs did not revert these phenotypes, except in the angiogenesis model, where they promoted cellular senescence in GCR-exposed cells. Antagomir treatment after space radiation modulates critical cellular pathways To specifically observe how key immune and inflammatory pathways are regulated with and without the antagomir treatment in the space environment, we analyzed a custom curation of genesets for innate and adaptive immune pathways (Fig. 9 ). There was an overall increased activity with GCR radiation exposure for the mature microvessel culture. However, when the antagomirs were applied, general inflammatory and immune pathways were restored back to the 0 Gy level for the mature microvessel model with a negative regulation in the angiogenesis cell model indicating that this countermeasure treatment diminished this response of GCR irradiation in the mature model (Fig. 9a ). Fig. 9. Antagomir countermeasure mitigates increases in innate immune activity.

Heatmaps of the t-scores for the individual genes in the b innate and c adaptive immune custom pathways. (* p -value < 0.05). For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p -value. In mature 3D microvessel models, GCR radiation treatment significantly upregulated several interferon-driven sensitive genes (ISGs), including DDX58, IFIH1 , IFIT2 , and to a lesser extent, IFIH1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFITM1, IFITM3, OAS1-2 amongst others (Fig. 9b ). Also upregulated by GCR radiation treatment were the cytokine/chemokine genes CXCL10 and CXCL11 , which function as pro-inflammatory molecules associated with activation, differentiation, and chemotaxis of immune cells. In contrast, treatment with the antagomirs produced decreased levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 and of all these ISG genes except for IFIH1 and OAS2 . The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex formed by NLRP3, PYCARD and CASP1 that plays a pivotal role in regulating the innate immune system and inflammatory signaling. Upon activation by cytosolic danger signals, the NLRP3 inflammasome activates CASP1 triggering the maturation of IL-1β , NF-κB activation, and the initiation of cell death via GSDMB 52 . GCR-treated cell cultures significantly upregulated NLRP3 and, to a lesser extent PYCARD , CASP1 , and NFKB1 , while treatment with antagomirs lessened the induction of these genes (Fig. 9b ). Together, the increases in ISGs, cytokines/chemokines and NLRP3 inflammasome indicate that GCR radiation exposure promotes a robust innate immune response associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory molecules and immune cell activation. In contrast, the antagomir treatment downregulates and restores these factors back to normal levels. The adaptive immune genes were not significantly altered, consistent with the transient cell stress induced by the GCR treatment and potentially due to the fact that the 3D cell model does not contain any T cells (Fig. 9c ). Mitochondrial damage mitigation after antagomir treatment with space radiation Mitochondrial stress has been previously implicated as a critical and consistently dysregulated phenotype during spaceflight 12 . Mitochondria play a crucial role in metabolism by integrating signals from stress and the environment, such as nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress, to coordinate cellular metabolism 53 . Thus, the MitoPathways collection 54 was used to examine mitochondria-related activity in our 3D cell culture model. GCR exposure combined with antagomir treatment in the mature microvessels significantly decreased expression of 106 of 149 available genesets (Fig. 10a ). Radiation exposure alone did not significantly alter 72 of these genesets as highlighted in Fig. 10b . Fig. 10. Mitigation of mitochondrial dysregulation and integrated stress response (ISR) with antagomir treatment on mature and angiogenesis 3D cell culture models irradiated with GCR.

For all RNA-seq data Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p -value. The largest of six major networks involves metabolism-linked MitoPathways where antagomirs with GCR exposure overwhelmingly downregulated 44 of 50 genesets (Fig. 10b ). Negative enrichment in 8 of 9 subpathways are associated with carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, metal, vitamin, and sulfur metabolism as well as detoxification. The substantial metabolic alterations may depend on the changes affecting the mitochondria which were also largely downregulated indicating an overall decrease in cellular energetics. The OXPHOS and Mitochondrial Central Dogma MitoPathways include crucial factors for oxidative phosphorylation functions (Complexes I-V subunits and assembly factors) and proteins encoded within mitochondrial DNA and factors involved in their expression, respectively. These genesets were nearly all decreased when antagomirs were added to the radiation exposure. The increased enrichment of 7 subpathways by radiation treatment alone (OXPHOS and OXPHOS subunits, CI and CV subunits, Complex I, Mitochondrial Ribosome, and Translation) was completely reversed with the antagomirs. In response to stress stimuli, eukaryotic cells activate the integrated stress response (ISR) to restore cellular homeostasis via communication between organelles 55 . The communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is essential for cellular homeostasis 42 , due to the large number of mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nucleus. Considering the observed decrease in mitochondrial and changes in stress pathways, the ISR genes were examined in more detail. GCR exposure in the mature 3D cell cultures downregulated ISR genes involved in amino acid uptake/biosynthesis, death factors, endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER-UPR) activation, and lipid metabolism, while only ISR survival genes were positivity enriched (Fig. 10c ). Fewer genesets were affected by GCR exposure, which increased the ATF4 targets geneset and decreased ER-homeostasis. Initiation of the ISR is driven by the activation of the kinases HRI (EIF2AK1), PKR (EIF2AK2), PERK (EIF2AK3), or GCN2 (EIK2AK4) which occurs in the mature cell model with GCR radiation (Fig. 10d ). These kinases phosphorylate eIF2α, impairing cytosolic protein synthesis and activating expression of the ISR transcription factors ATF4, ATF5 , and CHOP . Increased levels of ATF4, ATF5 , and CHOP in the angiogenesis cell model (Fig. 10c, d ) induce the expression of the downstream ISR-target genes involved in redox maintenance, lipid metabolism, amino acid uptake/biosynthesis, ER-homeostasis, death, survival, and the ER and mitochondrial UPR. For irradiation combined with the antagomirs, genesets are returned to baseline. These results suggest that cells activate ISR as an adaptive cellular response after exposure to space radiation, whereas this activation is prevented by the antagomirs (Fig. 10d ).",
    "Conclusion": "Our previous study 13 – 15 demonstrated a significant association between circulating miRNAs and spaceflight-associated health risks. These 13 circulating miRNAs were connected to the immune system, cellular differentiation, motility, proliferation, and survival 13 , 15 . Three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, were linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during spaceflight 13 , 15 , 56 . A collapse of microvessels in 3D cell cultures after exposure to space radiation 13 , 21 was associated with breakdown of the endothelial barrier and the loss of tight junctions 57 . GCR-induced inhibition of microvessels during angiogenesis was dependent on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the charged particles 58 , 59 . Although the microvessel cells are post-mitotic, differential effects on DNA repair occur according to radiation quality (e.g. LET) 20 . The mixed simplified simulation of GCR uses five ions of different energies (Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Silicon, and Iron) 48 which are highly effective at inhibiting angiogenesis 14 . Several studies have shown the cellular consequences of miRNA activity, including the three miRNAs researched in the present study. Let-7a is involved in many cellular processes, immunity, and protective functions 60 . The majority of cellular processes involving let-7a are well studied in development, proliferation, differentiation, and cancer, but its role in inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and/or stroke are not well understood 61 . Let-7a is involved in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell homeostasis such as self-renewal, proliferation, quiescence, and differentiation by blocking the TGFβ pathway and amplifying Wnt signaling 62 . MicroRNA 16 (miR-16) is linked to human malignancies 63 and can modulate the cell cycle, inhibit cell proliferation, promote cellular apoptosis, and suppress tumorigenicity 64 . The targets of miR-16 may be directly responsible for these effects such as the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) 65 , numerous genes involved in the G1-S transition, such as cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1 and CDK6 (cyclin-dependent kinase 6), and genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as WNT3A (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A) 66 . In endothelial cells, angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ), VEGF receptor-2 ( VEGFR2 ), and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 ( FGFR1 ), were identified by bioinformatic approaches and subsequently validated as targets by miR-16 67 . The miR-125 family plays an important role in the growth and development of animals, as well as stress response, p53 activation 68 and the occurrence and development of cancer 69 . In addition, the role of miR-125 in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cannot be ignored. The miR-125 family is associated with the development and differentiation of mammalian embryonic hearts 70 . Furthermore, it plays an important role in diseases and pathophysiological processes such as, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia-reperfusion injury, stroke, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial cell injury and myocardial cell apoptosis 70 . A recent paper has described the presence of miR-125b in osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs) 71 and in bone matrix where it hampers osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by targeting PRDM1 (PR domain zinc finger protein 1), thus suggesting that miR-125b might have an active role in the development of vascular calcifications 72 . All three miRNAs were initially found to be associated with cancer and neoplasia. However, unregulated cell cycle control is unlikely to be the only pathway that mitigates the biological effects of GCR. Our results from the mature microvessel model support this notion, since mature microvessels are postmitotic and the timing of events is too rapid to be downstream of cell cycle control, although this does not rule out an indirect involvement of cell cycle proteins. At 24 h after GCR irradiation and 48 h after antagomir treatment, protection of microvessel morphology is observed compared to the GCR-stressed control not treated with antagomirs. Individual inhibition of each target miRNA and the resulting mitigation of GCR effects suggests that each miRNA is similarly effective and therefore the targets of each must contain genes that are active in this process. Twelve of 21 key genes targeted by at least two of the three miRNAs (Fig. 5a ) are potential candidates for protecting the microvessel physiology. These include genes involved in apoptosis and p53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids, and cholesterol metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). However, apoptosis is not measurable in these cultures as much higher doses of heavy and light ions are needed to detect this mechanism 21 by TUNEL assay although this does not rule out earlier apoptosis signaling. Direct action of genes involved in the cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions is unlikely in mature microvessels. Involvement of cellular programs from the innate immune response is a possibility, since immune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by space radiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on suppressing DNA repair indicates a much earlier time of action, likely upstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of mature vessels. This suggests that early response genes involved in radiation exposure might be targets for the antagomirs; these would include genes of general inflammatory and immune pathways. There are 5 genes that are affected in common with all 3 antagomirs. When inhibited, all products of these genes are candidates for mediating the resistance to radiation damage, although the effects of other genes affected by each individual antagomir cannot be ruled out. Each gene has functions that could contribute to GCR resistance. APAF1 and NIBAN1 are involved in the control of apoptosis and may prevent progression towards senescence 73 . XPO6 and SLC7A1 are involved in transport across membranes between cell compartments, a process involved in early responses to cell stressors 74 , 75 . PDPR regulates pyruvate phosphorylation and may facilitate protective functions that require a higher energy output 76 . Overall it appears that several pathways are involved in protection and are acting in concert to push the cells into a more healthy and active biological state. Changes in immune response appear to be a hallmark of space radiation and targeted by miRNAs. We previously have shown that cytotoxic and helper T cells are suppressed and key innate immune response-related factors are dysregulated in C57BL/6 female mice exposed to 0.5 Gy GCR irradiation 14 . Markers of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (cytotoxic) T cell populations in the I4 astronauts (Fig. 6j, k ) also indicate dysregulation occurring during spaceflight. The similarities between both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate a parallelism that gives confidence about using the 3D cell culture model to confirm the effectiveness of the antagomir treatment strategy to prevent and countermeasure space radiation damage. Spaceflight can affect mitochondrial stability 12 . The ability of antagomirs to rescue mitochondria-associated pathways affected by radiation indicates the potential for using these antagomirs to rescue harmful phenotypes in space travelers. In particular, the OXPHOS pathway, which was downregulated upon treatment with GCR-stress, showed a rescue-like effect (Fig. 10 ). Impaired OXPHOS can lead to cell death due to insufficient ATP for energy use, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or overproduction of prooxidant agents 77 . Electron carriers, like the amidoxime-reducing complex, assists in this process and show downregulation in the presence of radiation. This radiation phenotype has the potential to progress to inflammation. Specifically, the genes whose upregulation was returned to normal by the addition of antagomir include those of complex I, complex V, and other OXPHOS subunits. Genotoxic stress caused by ionizing or UV radiations is a potent inducer of cellular senescence. Curiously, GCR suppresses most of the pathways associated with cellular senescence curated based on data from fibroblasts, renal epithelial cells and adipocytes induced to senescence by different stimuli, including X-ray irradiation, oncogene overexpression, antiretroviral drug or hyperinsulinemia 50 , 51 . This suggests that either GCR does suppress classical cellular senescence or GCR-induced senescence in our 3D cell culture differs from the previously studied mechanisms of senescence induction by radiation (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The latter is supported by previous evidence demonstrating that different senescence stimuli drive very distinct phenotypes 51 . The only senescence-related pathway induced by GCR in our model is oncogene-induced senescence, which is consistent with activation of p53 target genes. The antagomirs have no effect on the mature culture model, but in the irradiated angiogenesis model they promote various senescence-related pathways. Future studies are required to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models, in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population (fibroblast/pericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effect in vivo (human). The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied. We observe a significant change in orphan gene expression from GCR irradiation stress and from antagomir treatment (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Many orphan genes were upregulated in the 3D mature microvessel cell culture and interestingly, downregulated in the angiogenesis model. Some of these orphan genes may be integrated into the metabolic and regulatory processes that are targeted by the miRNAs. Orphan genes themselves are simple proteins that often act by binding to conserved proteins such as transcription factors or receptors 31 , 78 . Some orphan genes are key for reproduction, some are toxins, and many confer resistance to stress 30 , 31 , 79 – 82 , however, orphan genes do not appear to encode enzymes, likely because of the very long time scale required for evolution of a specialized catalytic site 82 . Many orphan genes are expressed to high levels only in discrete tissues or under specific abiotic stresses or diseases 30 , 32 , 79 , 82 , 83 . The alteration of orphan gene expression with GCR irradiation and antagomir treatment warrants further examination. Due to the nature of performing experiments in the space environment, it can be limiting and difficult to simulate perfectly the conditions in space in ground experiments. So to perfectly recreate the space radiation dose and dose-rate that astronauts will receive during long-duration spaceflights (lasting several months) is not possible. The ground-based experimental setup reported in this manuscript used for irradiating with GCRs currently represents the best approximation for validation of predictive models and while enabling countermeasure developments. Thus, extrapolation and comparison from the astronaut data to cell culture studies conducted on Earth as well as mice experiments both on Earth and during spaceflight are key to meaningful interpretation of biological results applicable to space flight. Lastly, it is possible that the differences in the radiation delivery might account for any deviations between the results we are observing. The present microvascularized model is a simplified system hosting endothelial cells only and one shall point out the absence of the very important pericytes. Indeed, it is well known that when endothelial cells organize into microvascular networks (during angiogenesis), stromal cells associate with newly formed microvessels to stabilize the structure. Fibroblasts can play this role by adopting a pericytic-type phenotype 84 – 86 . To push forward the full understanding of the GCR effect on angiogenesis, it might be necessary, in a close future, to complexify the model, at least toward a multicellular compartment 87 . In addition, it will be essential for future studies to test the toxicity of the antagomirs in in vivo models, since the tissue model utilized for this manuscript is limited for this purpose. The inhibition of three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, facilitates the reduction of cellular damage from ionizing radiation exposure. Treatment with antagomirs that inhibited these three miRNAs before and after radiation exposure in mature and angiogenesis 3D human HUVEC cell culture models, completely prevented the microvessel collapse and inhibition of microvessel development caused by GCR exposure. The potential effectiveness of these antagomirs to reduce prolonged tissue damage through modified DNA repair activity and alterations in cellular mitochondria offers a unique target for the development of radiation countermeasures for spaceflight as well as for terrestrial applications.",
