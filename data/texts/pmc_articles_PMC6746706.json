    "Abstract": "Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 ...",
    "Results": "The space environment causes changes in gene expression related to visual and RNA regulation pathways The space environment caused a wide array of changes in gene expression, the most prominent were changes in ocular pathways and RNA processing. Twenty mice spent 35 days on the International Space Station as part of NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). An additional twenty mice were housed on Earth in the same housing hardware used in flight for the ground control group. RNA sequencing was performed on sixteen mice (n = 8/group). 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the spaceflight and ground control groups using DESeq2 11 with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01 (Sup. Table 1 ). Hierarchical clustering was performed on the DEGs according to their expression values to determine which mice have similar DEG expression profiles. Mice clustered according to their inclusion in the ground control or spaceflight group. The spaceflight group had 286 upregulated genes and 314 downregulated genes compared to the ground control (Fig. 1A ). Figure 1. Open in a new tab DEG clustering and functions between spaceflight and control mice.

The spaceflight group had 286 upregulated genes and 314 downregulated genes compared to the ground control; (B) Enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process categories for DEGs. The affinity propagation option from WebGestalt was applied to the select representative display categories; (C) Enriched networks among DEGs from the Reactome database; (D) Enriched phenotypes impacted by the DEGs from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology; (B – D) Overrepresented categories were found relating to ocular function (GO categories: ‘visual perception’, ‘response to light stimulus’, ‘sensory perception of light stimulus’, ‘retina development in camera-type eye’; Pathways: ‘the phototransduction cascade’ ‘inactivation, recovery and regulation of the phototransduction cascade’; Phenotype: electrophysiology, morphology, and degeneration of the retina, rods, and cones), various RNA processing, splicing, and metabolism functions (GO categories: ‘RNA processing’, ‘rRNA processing’, ‘mRNA processing’, ‘RNA splicing’, via transesterification reactions’, ‘mRNA splicing, via spliceosome’, ‘rRNA metabolic process’, ‘ncRNA metabolic process’, ‘mRNA metabolic process’, ‘RNA transport’), and direct responses to the physical pressures of spaceflight (GO categories: ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to radiation’, ‘cellular response to stress’). An overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO), pathway, and phenotypic categories was performed on the DEGs using WebGestalt 12 . From this analysis, 46 GO, 5 pathway, and 14 phenotypic categories were found with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05 (Fig. 1B–D , Sup. Table 2 ). Included in the overrepresented categories are categories related to ocular function (GO categories: ‘visual perception’, ‘response to light stimulus’, ‘sensory perception of light stimulus’, ‘retina development in camera-type eye’; Pathways: ‘the phototransduction cascade’ ‘inactivation, recovery and regulation of the phototransduction cascade’; Phenotype: electrophysiology, morphology, and degeneration of the retina, rods, and cones), various RNA processing, splicing, and metabolism functions (GO categories: ‘RNA processing’, ‘rRNA processing’, ‘mRNA processing’, ‘RNA splicing’, via transesterification reactions’, ‘mRNA splicing, via spliceosome’, ‘rRNA metabolic process’, ‘ncRNA metabolic process’, ‘mRNA metabolic process’, ‘RNA transport’), and direct responses to the physical pressures of spaceflight (GO categories: ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to radiation’, ‘cellular response to stress’). Some genes were highly differentially expressed, but were not included in any of the GO category, pathway, or phenotype gene lists from the ORA (Sup. Fig. 1 ). Drd4 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene and was upregulated in the spaceflight group (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812). Drd4 is a dopamine receptor that control circadian rhythm in the mammalian retina 13 . Similarly, Hist1h2bc was not found in any categories of the ORA, but was upregulated in the spaceflight group (adjusted p-value: 1.66E-09; log2 fold-change: 0.526). Hist1h2bc has been previously shown to be upregulated in the aging retina 14 . Together, these genes support previous studies suggesting that spaceflight disrupts circadian rhythms and is a potential model for aging 15 , 16 . Genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa are differentially expressed in the space environment We sought to determine whether any of the DEGs from the spaceflight samples were also differentially expressed in common retinal diseases. We compiled a list of disease-associated genes for the following retinal diseases: retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal detachment. Human disease-associated gene lists were found using the DisGeNET database 17 . Genes in the DisGeNET database were filtered by their gene-disease association score (GDA). Only genes with a GDA greater than 0.2 were included in the analysis. This included disease-associated genes from expertly curated and animal model databases, but excluded disease-associated genes from inferences and text-mining databases. Disease-associated genes were converted to their mouse ortholog using the Mouse Genome Informatics database 18 . Genes that did not pass the DESeq2 threshold for the number of mean counts (i.e., they had an adjusted p-value equal to ‘NA’), were filtered out from the analysis. Present in the DisGeNet database were 75 genes associated with the disease retinitis pigmentosa, 14 genes with diabetic retinopathy, 8 genes with age-related macular degeneration, and 5 genes with retinal detachment (Sup. Table 3 ). Most of the disease-associated genes were unique to a single retinal disease, with the exception of Abca4 , Nmnat1 , Casp3 , and Crb1 , which were each shared across two diseases (Fig. 2A ). None of the disease-associated genes that were shared across multiple diseases were differentially expressed in spaceflight. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Retinal disease-associated gene expression. ( A ) UpSet diagram showing the number of genes in each disease set from DisGeNet. Genes that are distinct to each set are in the first four columns. Genes shared among sets are in the last three columns; (B) Log2 fold-change values of disease-associated genes. Genes are plotted from left to right in order of adjusted p-value. Bars are colored by the magnitude of the adjusted p-value. Adjusted p-values are further annotated based on their order of magnitude. The plot for retinitis pigmentosa displays the top 20 most significant genes based on adjusted p-value. All other diseases are displaying all of their associated genes. Of the 75 genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa, 12 were differentially expressed during spaceflight ( Sag, BC027072 /Pcare, Guca1b, Rbp3, Ahi1, Guca1a, Prpf8, Rp1, Gucy2e, Cacna2d4, Pde6b, Dhdds ), the most of any of the four retinal diseases examined. Diabetic retinopathy had one disease-associated gene that was differentially expressed during spaceflight ( Hif1a ). Age-related macular degeneration and retinal detachment disease-associated genes were not differentially expressed during spaceflight (Fig. 2B ). Differentially expressed transcription factors hint that spaceflight changes chromatin organization DEGs reported in Fig. 1A were filtered by their PANTHER protein class in order to find differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs) 19 . Out of the 600 DEGs, 29 are DETFs. Hierarchical clustering was performed on the DETFs according to their expression values. Mice clustered according to their inclusion in the ground control or spaceflight group (Fig. 3A ). Eight of the DETFs are necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye: Mafg , Isl1 , Atf5 , Kdm6b , Hmgb3 , Prox1 , Casz1 and Hif1a 20 – 27 . Of special interest are Cazs1 and Hif1a . Cazs1 is a heterochromatin regulator that acts in a splice-variant specific manner 24 and Hif1a inactivation has been shown to significantly mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in a chronic hypoxia-like stress model 25 . Figure 3. Open in a new tab Transcription factor clustering and functions between spaceflight and control mice. ( A ) Hierarchical clustering of the 29 DETFs between spaceflight and ground control mice; (B) Enriched gene ontology (GO) biological process categories for DETFs. An overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology (GO) terms was performed on the DETFs. 47 GO categories were found with an FDR of less than 0.05 (Sup. Table 4 ). The affinity propagation filter from WebGestalt was applied in order to find a reduced number of GO terms that are representative of all GO enrichment results. We found enrichment of GO categories related to DNA transcription (‘positive regulation of transcription’, DNA-templated, ‘negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated’), further affirming the role of these genes as transcription factors. Additionally, there were enriched GO categories relating to chromatin organization, including regulation of histone modification, histone lysine demethylation, negative regulation of histone H3K9 trimethylation (Fig. 3B ). The genes in these GO categories include Kdm4a, Kdm4b, and Kdm6b , which are known regulators of lysine methylation. Kdm4a and Kdm4b are regulators of H3K9me2/me3 28 , which is a regulator of constitutive heterochromatin and an indicator for the presence of constitutive heterochromatin. Kdm6b is a regulator of H3K27me2/me3 28 and is primarily responsible for the silencing of gene expression. The space environment decreases the thickness of retinal tissue and increases oxidative stress and cone photoreceptor damage Micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) images were generated in order to characterize global ocular morphology and to measure the thickness of the retina and surrounding tissues for ground control and spaceflight mice (Fig. 4A ). Total retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid layers of the eye decreased significantly in thickness (p < 0.05) during spaceflight (Fig. 4B ). Additionally, choroid deformation and folds were noticed in spaceflight mice (Fig. 4C ). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Spaceflight decreases the thickness of multiple layers of the eye. ( A ) Sagittal view of a ground control mouse. Layers of the eye on the right side of the image are annotated, from top-to-bottom, retina (0.077 mm), retina pigment layer (RPE, 0.038 mm), choroid (0.041 mm), sclera (0.059 mm); (B) Average thickness of the retinal layer, RPE layer, and the choroid layer measured by MicroCT in the spaceflight and control groups. Counts were averaged across five retinas per group. Values were represented as mean thickness + standard error (SEM). SEM of the mean is marked with error bars. Significantly lower in cross section thickness in the spaceflight group compared to the ground control group is denoted ‘*’ (p < 0.05). (C) Cross sections of the retina from control and spaceflight mice. GCL: ganglion cell layer; INL: inner nuclear layer; ONL: outer nuclear layer; IS: inner segment; OS: outer segment, RPE: pigment epithelium layer. Immunofluorescence staining with peanut agglutinin (PNA), a specific marker for cone photoreceptors, was performed in order to view cone photoreceptors in the eye. Cone photoreceptors show signs of degradation during spaceflight (Fig. 5A ). Our quantitative assessment (Fig. 5B ) revealed a strong trend decrease in density of cones in the spaceflight mice (950 counts/mm 2 ) compared to ground control group that had an average of 1199 counts/mm 2 (p = 0.06). Figure 5. Open in a new tab Spaceflight causes photoreceptor degradation and oxidative stress.

The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue); Scale bar = 50 mm. (B) Cell density for PNA–positive cone photoreceptors; ( C ) Immunofluorescence staining for HNE (red) in the retina layer. Scale bar = 50 µm; (D) Fluorescent intensity of the HNE marker in the photoreceptor layer of rods and cones (arrow); (E) Fluorescent intensity of the HNE marker across the retina; (F) Log2 fold-change of DEGs under the GO category “negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death”; ( B , D , E ) Counts were averaged across five retinas per group. Values are represented as mean density ± SEM. Significance values of the spaceflight group compared to ground controls are denoted with ‘*’ (p < 0.05), ‘**’ (p < 0.01), and ‘T’ (strong trend differences between spaceflight and ground controls; p = 0.06). The occurrence of lipid peroxidation was evaluated with antibody against 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which is an indicative marker of oxidative damage to the retina. Increased 4-HNE staining was seen in cone photoreceptors, retinal inner nuclear layer (INL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) after spaceflight compared to ground controls (Fig. 5C ). As shown in Fig. 5D , the fluorescent intensity profiles in the photoreceptor cones which reflects endogenous level of HNE, was also significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the spaceflight group compared to the ground controls. Fluorescent intensity from the HNE marker was also significantly increased in the GCL/INL of the spaceflight group for the retina (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5E ). Our RNA-seq experiment identified three DEGs - Pde8a, Hif1a, Hgf - that are part of the GO Biological Process category for ‘negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced cell death’ (GO:1903202) (Fig. 5F ). Pde8a is a member of the phosphodiesterase family. Phosphodiesterase specific member inhibition has been previously shown to attenuates oxidative stress in diverse tissues 29 – 32 . Hif1a was shown to protect against oxidative stress directly at the mitochondria 33 , but the effects of this gene were shown to be highly contextual in the presence of reactive oxygen species 34 . Hgf activates an antioxidant signaling pathway that culminates in increased levels of nitric oxide and the activity of antioxidant enzymes regulated by this molecule 35 , 36 . Taken together, the upregulation of Pde8a and the downregulation of the Hif1a and Hgf are linked to the development of increased oxidative stress in the retina.",
    "Conclusion": "We have found a distinct gene expression signature in the retina of mice exposed to the spaceflight environment compared with the ground control. This signature is enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Other studies have also shown changes of gene expression involved in cell structure, growth, migration and adhesion in the retinal cells exposed to simulated microgravity 37 , 38 . Less anticipated was the overrepresentation of genes related to RNA processing, metabolism, and transport pathways for the first time described as relevant for spaceflight in mammals. A recent study in Arabidopsis thaliana has discovered mRNA isoforms created by alternative splicing that are unique to their spaceflight exposed samples 39 . Our results indicate that in addition to Arabidopsis thaliana , there may be splice isoform alterations in mammals during spaceflight as well that should be explored in future work and included in the risk assessment for long duration space missions. Differential RNA splicing has also been implicated as a potential disease-causing mechanism for retinitis pigmentosa. Mutations in the gene Rho , which creates a protein that composes rod photoreceptors and is essential for vision in low-light conditions, can alter its splice isoforms. These alternate isoforms lead to the construction of abnormal RHO proteins and trigger the pathology of retinitis pigmentosa 40 . Additionally, proper alternative splicing of Nxnl1 from rod photoreceptors and other ocular cell types has been associated with cone photoreceptor maintenance 41 , 42 . Disruption of these splice isoforms can reduce the density of cone photoreceptors and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer of the retina 43 . Overall, our results indicate that the space environment might create unique epigenetic events and differential RNA splicing, in addition to the altered gene expression profile reported. Future studies should address which genes are alternatively spliced to understand potential changes in protein structure and find further associations with retinal diseases. Furthermore, mouse models for retinitis pigmentosa are available. Determining which mouse model is most similar to mice exposed to the space environment will help determine the appropriate model to perform Earth-analog experiments. Finding an appropriate Earth-based analog will accelerate the speed of research dedicated to finding a countermeasure for the retinal damage caused by spaceflight. Several transcription factors were identified as necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye 20 . Although eight of the DETFs are known for their importance for the retinal development and maintenance in Earth conditions, 21 of the DETFs have no reports in the literature linking them to the eye tissue. From the DETF overrepresentation analysis, transcription factors were identified that are known to influence chromatin architecture. Changes in chromatin architecture indicate that the cause for changes in retinal structure observed during spaceflight is more complex than solely alterations in RNA processing. The overrepresentation analysis showed enrichment of transcriptional regulators for H3K9 demethylation, which is a marker for constitutive heterochromatin. Demethylation of H3K9 can result in the unraveling of this heterochromatin, which can then influence the accessibility of genes and regulatory elements in the genome 44 . This can further drive changes in gene expression and either create abnormal and potentially harmful cellular behavior or act as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate damage the retinal tissue has experienced from spaceflight. The connections between chromatin reorganization as a disease-causing or disease-mitigating mechanism during spaceflight has not yet been explored. Determining the locations of chromatin reorganization could provide insight to these questions. Furthermore, the literature does not report any of the DETFs directly related to retinitis pigmentosa, which could indicate that these genes, although not yet described, could have a role in retinitis pigmentosa or that they are part of spaceflight specific expression network that can be explored as biomarkers and/or drug targets. Compensatory mechanisms to mitigate cellular damage have been observed in response to oxidative stress. Our immunostaining for marker 4-HNE showed evidence of oxidative stress within the retina. Evidence of a response to this oxidative stress was also observed in the gene expression data. The gene Bnip3 was differentially expressed, showing upregulation during spaceflight (adjusted p-value: 2.94E-03; log2 fold-change: 0.309). Bnip3 is known for its role in removing misfolded proteins from the cell 45 . Misfolded proteins can occur as a result of oxidative stress. Also upregulated in the spaceflight data are heat shock genes Hsp90aa1 , Hsp90b1 , and Hspa4l which can assist correct protein folding and are known to protect against oxidative stress 46 , 47 . From this, we see evidence of a potential compensatory mechanism becoming activated in spaceflight in order to correct and mitigate cellular damage accumulating in retinal tissue. One consideration for long duration space missions are the compensatory mechanisms that are activated in the space environment. For long duration missions, it becomes imperative to evaluate for how long these compensatory mechanisms can be sustained and how to extend or amplify its beneficial effects. Additionally, the nearest Earth-analog disease that we identified, retinitis pigmentosa, has known links to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although no cure is currently known, supplementation with certain minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin A, has been demonstrated to delay the disease progression 48 and should be considered a possible countermeasure to spaceflight induced retinal damage. We also found evidence that the circadian rhythm of the retina was altered in spaceflight. The circadian rhythm regulates behavioral and physiological processes over a 24-hour period, principally controlled by day/night patterns. Disruptions in the circadian rhythm can lead to irregular sleep patterns, mood, and metabolism function, as well as the development of cancer 49 . The differentially expressed gene with the smallest adjusted p-value, Drd4 (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812), is a dopamine receptor that has been associated with the circadian rhythm. Specifically, Drd4 downregulates the gene Adcy1 13 , which was also found to be differentially expressed in this study (adjusted p-value: 1.45E-09; log2 fold-change: −0.427). Adcy1 produces cyclic AMP, a signalling mechanism in numerous retinal functions, such as retinomotor movements, disc shedding, certain types of retinal degeneration, and apoptosis of photoreceptors 50 – 52 . Circadian rhythm genes are of special interest in the space environment, where day/night light signals are irregular. For example, astronauts aboard the ISS will experience up to 16 sunsets and sunrises a day 53 . However, the mice in our experiment were in constant 12-h light/dark cycle, which leads us to believe that events other than the light/dark cycle itself are driving the changes in the circadian rhythm. Increased photoreceptor cone damage, reduced thickness of the retinal ONL, retinal INL, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye in the spaceflight group compared to ground control were reported in our study. Proton radiation-induced damage to the photoreceptor layer was also observed in our previous rodent study 54 . It is important to note that changes in global ocular structure and retinal layer thickness could have clinical and/or pathological significance 34 . The ONL contains the nuclei of the photoreceptor cells and the INL contains the cell bodies of bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and Müller cells. Our published study from a Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) showed a significant increase of apoptosis in the ONL and INL of the photoreceptor layer in spaceflight mice 2 . Photoreceptor loss is responsible for irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases 55 and photoreceptors are more sensitive to environmental damage 56 . Retinal damage, retinal photoreceptor cell loss, and thinning of the inner retina precede subsequent capillary degeneration 57 , 58 . Our findings strongly implicate the space environment causes retinal injury and the potential development and progression of retinal degeneration. The potential benefit of micro-CT in quantitative evaluation of ophthalmologic structure was encouraging. Our results showed degradation in ocular structures by spaceflight, particularly of the retina, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye, as evidenced by their decreased thickness. MicroCT provides an easy and non-destructive technique to image without any modification. Additionally, it shows the entire region of interest digitally, thereby increasing accessibility and reproducibility of the findings. Future work should use volumetric data to perform other analyses that take advantage of the micro-CT imaging capabilities, since it has been used successfully for studying many normal and pathologic tissues 59 . One area of concern is whether observed degradation of photoreceptors, retinal damage, and ocular structure alteration will persist or whether it will reverse once the organism is returned to Earth. Future studies should investigate the long-term impact of observed structural changes of the retina and retinal photoreceptors function that may lead to late retinal degeneration. Additional studies are needed to determine which aspects of spaceflight are responsible for photoreceptor damage and oxidative stress. Leading causes include radiation and possible alterations in intracranial pressure (ICP) or intraocular pressure (IOP) 60 , 61 induced by microgravity. It is possible that both space radiation and microgravity work in conjunction with one another to cause a more severe pathological result than either would in isolation. Other factors that may be driving differential gene expression include increased stress an organism experiences due to the physiological pressures of spacecraft takeoff and landing and the psychological pressures of spaceflight. The body size of an organism also impacts the amount of interstitial fluid per gram of body weight, which could impact the magnitude of fluctuating pressures influencing the retina 62 . Studies using larger organisms could better model the degree of fluctuating pressures experienced by humans during spaceflight. There are many potential avenues left to explore in order to understand the response of the mammalian retina to spaceflight. In this study we have characterized the physical response of the retina, the degradation of photoreceptors, and the presence of oxidative stress markers. We have also observed several genes with significant differential expression in the spaceflight condition were also differentially expressed in the disease retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, we suspect the changes that we are observing during spaceflight are influenced by alternative splicing and chromatin reorganization. There remains much work to be done on understanding the mechanism of spaceflight-induced oxidative stress on retinal damage. Additional work will need to be done to separate disease-causing changes in gene expression from compensatory changes. We also believe these data will be useful for understanding other spaceflight-related health concerns, such as misregulation of the circadian rhythm and accelerated aging. A full list of DEGs has been provided as a resource (Sup. Table 1 ) toward further understanding of associations between spaceflight, retinal function, and overall mammalian health.",
