    "Abstract": "Abstract The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment. Keywords: spaceflight, retina, photoreceptor, oxidative stress, antioxidant",
    "Results": "2.1. Body Weight Mice were weighed before launch and shortly before being euthanized after landing. Prior to taking off, the body weights were similar among all groups. The flight (FLT) and habitat ground control (GC) groups weighed between 25 and 27 g. The body mass after landing, for both the saline control and BuOE-treated FLT mice, was not significantly different compared to that of pre-flight measurements. However, body weights for the age-matched GC groups were significantly ( p < 0.05) increased following the flight compared to pre-flight measurements ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Open in a new tab Pre- and post-flight body mass in the flight (FLT) and habitat ground control (GC) groups. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM for mice in each group. * Significantly higher than pre-flight measurements ( p < 0.05). 2.2. IOP Measurement IOP was measured from a randomly selected left or right eye of each mouse before launch and shortly after landing. The post-flight saline and BuOE-treated FLT groups showed a decreasing trend in IOP, compared to pre-flight measurements, but there were no statistical differences with 11.4 and 10.2 mmHg for pre- vs. post-flight saline group, and 11.3 and 10.3 mmHg for pre- vs. post-flight BuOE-treated groups, respectively. The measurements for the flight groups were similar to that of the GC groups ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Open in a new tab Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Each bar represents the mean counts from the left or right eyes of pre- and post-flight IOP for flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mice (n = 8). Six readings were made to obtain an average count as a single IOP readout. Values are the means ± SEM. 2.3. ERG Assessment of Retinal Function To assess the mouse retinal function, we measured the amplitude of the ERG a-wave, which is generated by the activation of photoreceptors, a measure of photoreceptor function, and b-wave, which is primarily generated by the ON-type bipolar cell neurons [ 15 ]. Representative ERG waveforms for FLT saline vs. GC saline and FLT saline vs. FLT BuOE-treated groups were compared in Figure 3 a,b. The figures illustrate average a- and b-wave amplitude measurements in response to the strongest flash, with stimulus energies of log 2.5 cd·s/m 2 over implicit time. The amplitudes for a- and b-waves for the flight groups were reduced when compared to controls. The waveforms were similar between post-flight saline and BuOE-treated groups. The longitudinal changes of amplitude and implicit time (time-to-peak) for a- and b-waves with increased flash intensities for pre- and post-flight FLT and GC groups were presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5 . Differences in amplitude and implicit time to light stimulation were noted in the FLT group following the spaceflight when they were compared to pre-flight measurements or the GC group. Reduced amplitudes and delayed peak time observed in the FLT group may indicate low sensitivity of cone cells in response to stimulus flash. Figure 3.

( c ) Changes in the implicit time of post-flight FLT and GC groups. Each point represents the mean ± SEM (n = 8). Note that the response is lower with increased flash intensity in the post-flight group compared to the pre-flight response. The response is similar between pre- and post-flight measurements in the GC group. Figure 5.

Each point represents the mean± SEM (n = 8). Note that the response is lower with increased flash intensity in the post-flight group compared to the pre-flight response. The response is similar between pre- and post-GC measurements. When compared to pre-flight, the amplitude of the a- and b-wave that reflected an average response to all flash intensities in the post-flight group was significantly reduced ( p < 0.05) for both saline and BuOE-treated groups ( Figure 6 a,c), while the amplitude of a- and b-waves for pre- and post-flight in the GC group was similar ( Figure 6 b,d). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pre- and post-flight comparison of the average response to the light sensitivity of the retina to the a- and b-wave in saline and BuOE-treated (FLT) and habitat control (GC) groups. The amplitudes were averaged over 8 flash strength from −1.7 to 2.5 log cd s/m 2 .

Bars represent the mean+ SEM (n = 8). When the a-waves of post-flight groups were compared, there were statistical differences ( p < 0.05) in average amplitudes between FLT and GC ( Figure 7 ), while no differences were noted among the groups when measured pre-flight. The amplitude of the a-wave in the BuOE-treated group was close to the GC controls. Our ERG data also showed that the average amplitude of the b-wave that elicited a light-invoked slow cornea-positive potential was significantly ( p < 0.05) decreased by 39% and 25% in FLT saline or BuOE-treated mice compared to their habitat ground control counterparts, respectively ( Figure 8 ). No differences for b-waves were found among any of the pre-flight groups. Figure 7.

Apoptosis in the Retina Apoptosis in the retina and retinal endothelial cells (ECs) was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end label (TUNEL) staining. Apoptotic cells labeled with green fluorescence ( Figure 9 a) were mostly detected in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL). Quantitative assessment revealed that the density of apoptotic cells in the retina of the flight saline group was 67% higher than GC controls, with a strong trend difference ( p = 0.056) ( Figure 9 b). The counts for apoptosis were similar between the BuOE-treated and saline flight groups. The data demonstrate that spaceflight conditions induce retinal apoptosis. The retinal ECs showed a similar level of apoptosis across all groups ( Figure 9 c). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Quantification of apoptosis based on terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end label (TUNEL) staining of flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) mouse retina. ( a ) TUNEL-positive cells were identified with green fluorescence and the endothelium was stained with lectin in red. TUNEL-positive cells that were laid within red lectin-labeled endothelium were identified as TUNEL-positive endothelial cells. The nuclei of photoreceptors were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 50 μm. ( b ) Apoptotic cell density in the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the FLT and the GC mice. ( c ) Apoptotic cell density in the retinal endothelium of the FLT and GC groups. Values are represented as the mean density ± SEM (n = 5). The density profiles were expressed as the mean number of apoptotic-positive cells/mm 2 . Measurements across five retinal sections per eye were used as a single experimental value. Strong trend differences between FLT saline vs. GC saline ( p = 0.058), and FLT BuOE vs. GC BuOE ( p = 0.056). 2.5. Oxidative Damage in the Photoreceptor The 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) marker for oxidative damage was evaluated in the retina. Enhanced 4-HNE staining was seen in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL in the spaceflight group compared to all other groups ( Figure 10 a). As shown in Figure 10 b, the fluorescent intensity of 4-HNE in the photoreceptor cones of the flight group mice was significantly increased ( p < 0.05) compared to both the ground controls and the BuOE-treated flight group. The immunoactivity of HNE immunoreactivity in BuOE-treated FLT retina was similar to saline or BuOE-treated GC groups. Figure 10.

Cone photoreceptors were stained with a specific immunofluorescent marker of peanut agglutinin (PNA). Quantitative evaluation ( Figure 10 c) revealed a decrease of 20% in the cone photoreceptor density in the spaceflight saline mice, with an average of 812 counts/mm 2 compared to the GC group which had an average of 1007 counts/mm 2 ( p = 0.067). There were no significant differences in the cone density between the flight saline and BuOE groups.",
    "Conclusion": "Observed changes following spaceflight include increased oxidative damage and increased apoptosis in the mouse retinal nuclear layer and photoreceptors. ERG data, for the first time, demonstrated that spaceflight evoked changes in photoreceptor function in a mouse model. The average amplitudes of a- and b-waves for the flight group were significantly reduced when compared to controls. Our results show that FLT mice did not gain weight after the flight as was observed for the age-matched GC group. Other spaceflight studies reported a loss in body mass after spaceflight [ 16 , 17 ]. It has been proposed that the lack of increase in body mass may be related to mixed factors, including dehydration, stress, altered glucose, and lipid metabolism, or less food consumption [ 18 , 19 ]. Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for the development and progression of many ocular diseases, especially glaucoma [ 20 ]. IOP and intracranial pressure (ICP) changes are suspected to be involved in the ocular anatomical changes and visual function impairment exhibited by some astronauts [ 21 ]. Results from head–down bed-rest studies, which simulate the microgravity effects, have shown IOP and ocular blood flow changes. These changes are implicated in the pathophysiology of optic disk edema [ 22 ]. For our study, within 20 h of splashdown, we measured the IOP of flight and control groups in fully conscious mice. The data were consistent with previous observations and showed no significant differences between pre- and post-flight groups, or between flight and control groups. This indicates that a 35-day space mission may have a limited impact on irreversible IOP changes pathologically. One possible explanation is that IOP is a transient and time-sensitive parameter. Changes can happen within seconds to minutes. Due to logistical limitations, we were unable to measure IOP until 20 h after splashdown, and elevations in this readout may not have been detectable. Studies have shown that IOP fluctuates considerably with time, body postural change, venous pressure changes, and stress levels [ 23 ]. Further evaluation of IOP during spaceflight or longer time sustained microgravity conditions will be required. The ERG is an electrical potential generated in response to light stimulation of the retina and recorded from the corneal surface of the eye. ERG technology is a powerful approach in assessing retina function [ 24 ] and ganglion cell activity [ 25 ]. The mouse retina expresses a short wavelength-sensitive and a middle/long wavelength-sensitive opsin (S- and M-opsin) [ 26 ], whereby the S-cones are responsive to ultraviolet (UV) peak at 360 nm, and M-cones and rods are responsive to the green light at peak 504 nm. Previous studies suggested that the mouse cone system predominantly expresses S-opsin [ 27 ]. Since S-opsin sensitivity drops significantly at wavelengths longer than 425 nm, only UV light is efficient in stimulating mouse S-opsin [ 27 ]. In our present study, we focused on probing S-cone-mediated properties using UV light stimulation. Despite the small percentage of cones in the mouse photoreceptor (5%) [ 28 ], cone-mediated responses in mouse ganglion cells are fast and sensitive. Our measurement enables us to quantify cone-mediated response and correlate this with histochemistry evaluation. Cone bipolar pathways are similar to those found in mammals [ 29 ]. Therefore, the mouse is potentially a useful model to study cone-mediated vision and for diseases that affects the cone function in humans [ 27 , 29 ]. The two ERG components that are most often measured are the a- and b-waves. The a-wave is the first large negative component that reflects the physiological status of photoreceptor rods and cones, followed by the b-wave, which is a cornea-positive amplitude. The b-wave reflects the health of the inner layers of the retina, including the ON bipolar cell and Müller cell depolarization in response to increases in light stimulation [ 15 ]. Reduced a- and b-wave amplitudes documented in the flight group indicate retinal photoreceptor damage and disturbance of retinal physiological function. These changes are associated with the observed increase in apoptosis in the inner nuclear ganglion cell layer, and a decrease in cone density following spaceflight. Abnormal ERG is recognized in many ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and cone dystrophy [ 15 , 30 , 31 ]. Most human retina disorders are detected by attenuation of amplitude [ 25 ]. Studies have also shown a correlation between a decrease in cone-driven function through reductions of dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes and cone photoreceptor loss in a light damage model [ 32 ]. Our ERG and histological findings, for the first time, show that spaceflight-induced retinal functional change may occur as a result of photoreceptor damage and cellular death. It is important to characterize and monitor retinal changes that may lead to the progression of retinal disease and retinal degeneration. Retinal neurons include amacrine, ganglion cells, and photoreceptors. Radiation-induced photoreceptor loss has been shown in a previous study with 1 Gy of iron-56 irradiation [ 33 ]. Studies from the Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) and Rodent Study-9 (RR-9) also showed a significant increase in apoptotic cell damage in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and INL of the flight mice photoreceptors [ 34 , 35 ]. Retinal nuclear cell damage causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases [ 36 ]. Retinas are more sensitive to environmental damage than other central nervous system (CNS) neurons [ 37 ]. Apoptotic cell death is documented in many forms of retinal vascular dysfunction and degeneration [ 38 ]. These findings suggest that retinal nuclear and photoreceptor cells play an important role in maintaining the normal structure and function of the retina. Our data revealed significant increases in retinal nuclear/photoreceptor cell death and a trend showing a decrease in cone density by spaceflight. The presence of apoptotic positive cells in this study supports the hypothesis that apoptotic mechanisms are involved in retinal cell death. Further studies will be required to determine whether these effects are reversible or continue to deteriorate over time. Oxidative stress-induced ocular tissue damage has been associated with a variety of pathological conditions [ 2 , 39 , 40 ]. Oxidative stress is one of the leading causes of retinal damage and retinal degenerative diseases [ 41 ]. Radiation-induced oxidative stress can damage critical cellular structure and biomolecules [ 42 ], resulting in inflammatory responses, cell death, and tissue remodeling [ 43 , 44 ]. We have shown in our previous studies that spaceflight and space radiation exposures cause oxidative changes in the retina and retinal vasculature [ 34 , 45 , 46 ]. HNE is a secondary product of lipid peroxidation during oxidative stress [ 47 ]. This flight study documented increased oxidative damage with 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL [ 4 ]. The correlation between increased oxidative damage in photoreceptors and abnormal ERG recording indicates that spaceflight impacts the retinal structure, physiology and function. In future studies, we will determine if these observed changes will persist or reverse with a longer re-adaption period. The safety of BuOE has been evaluated in a battery of nonclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant studies. Systemic toxicity has been evaluated using the intended cGMP product administered subcutaneously for periods of up to 5 weeks in both mouse and the monkey, and have included toxicokinetic evaluations to characterize systemic exposure, tissue distribution, and clearance of BuOE [ 48 ]. Redox-active metalloporphyrin antioxidants have been shown to be effective in protecting against radiation-induced ocular damage [ 11 ]. In the present study, with the current injection dose, our results showed that BuOE is safe. Body weights among saline- or BuOE-treated ground control groups were similar and no overt sign of toxicity related to this compound was observed. Immunoreactivity of the oxidative stress biomarker, HNE, was significantly reduced in the BuOE-treated flight group compared to the flight saline group. This suggests that BuOE was effective in reducing reactive oxygen species that activate retinal stress responses during space flight [ 49 , 50 ]. Metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidants are potent detoxifiers of lipid peroxides and lipoperoxyl radicals, a process that is mediated via hydroxyl radicals [ 6 , 51 ]. Our present study suggests that oxidative stress is a contributing mechanism for observed damage in the retina and photoreceptor, which was demonstrated by increased 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation. Adding BuOE, a lipophilic metalloporphyrin compound with high potency for the catalysis of lipid peroxidation reduced immunoreactivity of the biomarker in the BuOE-treated ocular tissue compared to the flight saline group, suggesting a potential mechanism of oxidative stress in inducing cellular damage. However, BuOE was found to only slightly mitigate spaceflight-induced apoptosis in retinal photoreceptor or endothelial cells, suggesting that apoptosis was not inhibited. Administration of BuOE had limited effects in attenuating spaceflight-induced retinal functional change assessed by ERG recording, although it was more effective in restoring a-wavet responses than b-wave responses, especially at high flash intensity ( Figure 3 b). It may be that the beneficial or protective effects of BuOE with the current dosage was not sufficient to significantly ameliorate the harmful spaceflight-induced effects on the retina or that alternative stressors may be directly leading to apoptosis despite reduced oxidative stress. Due to logistic limitations, the compound was injected once a week in orbit. More frequent injections may be required to protect retinal function more effectively. Daily [ 52 , 53 ] or twice-weekly [ 54 ] administration schedules have been reported to have significant protective effects from oxidative damage in other disease models. Free radicals produced in the ocular tissues by the mechanism other than ROS, which include reactive nitrogen species, and reactive carbonyl species [ 55 ], may be equally important in inducing cellular damage in the retina. Another plausible explanation is that spaceflight conditions induced an imbalanced oxidative/antioxidative homeostasis and antioxidant defense enhanced by this redox-active compound may lead to apoptotic pathway regulation and recovery of retinal function at a later time. We plan to evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers, apoptotic status, and retinal function parameters at three months following live animal return to Earth, to further assess the ocular tissue re-adaptation process. It is anticipated that a redox-active metalloporphyrin can be effective in protecting against spaceflight-induced retinal damage.",
