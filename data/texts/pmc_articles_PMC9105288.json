    "Abstract": "Abstract Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1 , PIN3 , IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 ( UBQ1 ) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.

    "Results": "2.1. Time Course of Curvature As reported earlier [ 1 ], dicotyledonous plants such as Brassica, Radish and Flax show a bi-phasic and combined graviresponse of the root-shoot axis. The time course of curvature involves a transient curvature of the root tip. Upon straightening of the tip, the hypocotyl base begins to respond as positively gravitropic. The graviresponse is completed after about 20 h. The sampling intervals were chosen to coincide with the onset of hypocotyl curvature (four hours after reorientation), the midpoint of curvature (45-degree curvature of the hypocotyl; 11 h) and vertically oriented seedlings (48 h after the initial reorientation). 2.2. Nucleic Acid Extraction, Yield, and Reference RNA extraction of tissue was performed along the upper and lower flank of the basal hypocotyl from tissue extraction or by Solid Phase Gene Extraction ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Open in a new tab ( A ) Extraction of mRNA using Solid Phase Gene Extraction: Oligo-dT15 functionalized stainless-steel needles were inserted into the upper and lower side of horizontally placed hypocotyls and the root tip of Brassica rapa seedlings. The hybridization between the dT and poly A tail of the mRNA was accomplished in 60 s. ( B ) Drawings that represent hypocotyl curvature during the experiments. ( C ) Sampling of the upper and lower flank of hypocotyl tissue. The average cDNA yield was based on the amount of cDNA after reverse transcription. The tissue extraction (258 ± 16 µg) was significantly higher ( p < 10 −10 ) than the yield from SPGE probes (0.654 ± 0.024 µg). Nonetheless, reliable qPCR experiments of SPGE samples were possible. Although UBQ1 transcription was not steady ( Figure 2 ), the changes were small in comparison to auxin-sensitive genes and UBQ1 transcription between the upper and lower flank remained similar ( p = 0.75) throughout the experimental period ( Figure 3 ); therefore, UBQ1 is an acceptable reference gene. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Absolute Cq values for UBQ1 obtained by tissue extraction (solid lines) and SPGE (patterned lines). The top flank showed reduced (higher Cq values) transcription compared to the bottom flank. The numbers 1–6 correspond to locations in Figure 1 . Mean ± SE, n = 9. Figure 3.

Time = 0 refers to vertical position. Transcription of UBQ1 did not change significantly after reorientation ( p = 0.75); mean ± SE, n = 9. 2.3. Transcription in the Hypocotyl Base Tissue The transcription of auxin related genes PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were similar on the left and right flanks of vertically oriented hypocotyls ( Figure 4 ) but changed after horizontal reorientation. PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 were downregulated along the top flank but upregulated in the bottom tissue. PIN1 transcription did not change during the first four hours but after 11 h of reorientation increased in the lower flank and decreased along the upper flank. At that time, all genes showed maximal changes in transcription activities ( Figure 5 ). Figure 4.

Mean ± SE, n = 9. Figure 5. Open in a new tab Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in tissue samples of the upper (black) and lower (red) flank of hypocotyls of horizontally reoriented Brassica rapa seedlings four and 11 h after reorientation relative to the transcription of UBQ1. The transcription was upregulated in the bottom flank and downregulated in upper flank. The least significant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean ± SE, n = 9. The transcription analysis by SPGE showed similar profiles as the tissue data. The downregulation of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 along the top coincided with upregulation along the lower flank ( Figure 6 ) four and 11 h after reorientation. After 48 h, when the hypocotyl approaches vertical position, this trend of transcription expression was reversed, i.e., transcription was upregulated in the upper flank and downregulated in the lower flanks. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Log (2) fold change in transcription level of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 after Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) of curving Brassica rapa hypocotyls relative to UBQ1 values. Probe 1 (apical end of curvature zone), 2 (center), and 3 (basal end, at root/shoot junction) sampled the upper flank (black lines) and probes 4, 5 and 6 sampled the corresponding positions along the bottom flank (red lines), see Figure 1 . The transcription profiles are shown for 4, 11 and 48 h after horizontal reorientation. Positive and negative values indicate up- and downregulation, respectively. The least significant difference (LSD) is based on the error of all measurements per panel. Mean ± SE, n = 9. SPGE sampling showed the largest difference in transcription at the point of the maximum curvature (probe #2 and #5, Figure 1 ) compared to the adjacent positions after four and 11 h. The ratio of the fold change over time of all genes at position five vs. two varied by gene and showed the smallest signal after 48 h ( Figure 6 ). Considering the transcription for probe two and five (the points of maximal curvature on the convex and concave flank, respectively, for different time points showed that after four hours, the ratio for PIN1 and ARG1 was similar. IAA5 transcription was twice as high at the bottom (#5) than top (#2) position. At 11 h, PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 showed similar values for the convex and concave sites. The polarity of IAA5 was less, but still reached about five times the value of the top flank. After 48 h, the values were reversed and the polarity for PIN1, PIN3, and ARG1 between the top and bottom side was about six to eight-fold; the polarity for IAA5 was weaker. These data show that after reversal of the curvature the transcription of the examined genes reached a comparable but reversed polarity as after 11 h. 2.4. Tissue and SPGE Extraction The average of the transcription values of all three SPGE probes on either flank was compared with corresponding tissue data of the lower and upper flank. The SPGE values for all examined genes were similar or slightly higher than the tissue values. The overall profile for all tested genes was comparable for both methods, i.e., upregulation along the bottom flank and downregulation in the upper side until 11 h after reorientation ( Figure 7 ). Consistently, this trend was reversed after 48 h. The transcription of all genes showed the greatest variability 11 h after reorientation, consistent with the onset of curvature reversal from positive to negative. Figure 7.

The data for SPGE top and bottom refers to the average values of the combined probes 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5, 6, respectively. All values are shown as fold change based on UBQ1. Mean ± SE, n = 9. 2.5. Comparison of the Hypocotyl and Root Tip As illustrated [ 1 ], the hypocotyl responds to gravity in sequentially positive and then negative curvature. In contrast, the root tip always exhibits positive gravicurvature. Therefore, a comparison of both tissues shows the extent and magnitude of synchronous changes in the transcription of relevant genes. ARG1 showed the highest transcription value compared to the other examined genes ( Figure 8 ). The transcription of all genes increased strongly at four hours followed by a gradual increase at 11 h after reorientation. SPGE showed upregulation for both PIN1 and ARG1 at all times after reorientation. PIN3 transcription remained constant until four hours after reorientation, followed by continued but reduced upregulation. Although IAA5 increased in the tissue (red line) this gene remained unchanged for SPGE data. Interestingly, the magnitude of upregulation for all genes at 11 h after SPGE extraction was in the range of the earlier tissue data points, except for ARG1. Therefore, a drastic difference in values was observed. Similar to the root tip, we considered the average of the hypocotyl tissue (i.e., the average of top and bottom flanks) and found that the transcription levels of all genes were similar ( p = 0.25) for the hypocotyl and root tip regardless of orientation or time after reorientation. Figure 8. Open in a new tab The transcription profile of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in the root tip after horizontal reorientation of B. rapa seedlings. Data were tissue (red) or SPGE (black) sampling of the 2 mm tip region. The transcripts were referenced to UBQ1. The least significant difference (LSD) was calculated separately for tissue and SPGE samples. Mean ± SE, n = 3.",
    "Conclusion": "3.1. UBQ1 as Reference We verified the usage of UBQ1 as a reference, as UBQ1 expression in both sides of the vertical and top and bottom flanks of the curving hypocotyls did not change significantly ( Figure 2 ). The observed, minor changes in UBQ1 may not be related to curvature but the effect of development and/or differentiation. Hence, UBQ1 was identified as a reference gene [ 62 ] and it was equally expressed in the upper and lower flanks of the gravicurving roots of the Brassica rapa seedlings [ 59 ]. 3.2. Transcription of Auxin Related Genes The transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse of B. rapa and is likely mediated by auxin as auxin-induced elongation along the convex side of hypocotyls coincides with the upregulation of these genes, while the concave side shows the reduction in transcription. The connection of these genes with auxin is well established [ 29 , 63 , 64 ], and at least for PIN1 and PIN3, the transcription pattern over time was identical ( Figure 5 ). The initiation and termination of bending [ 65 ] is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin flow to the upper flank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl [ 1 ]. The differential elongation [ 4 ] corresponds with the observed transcription changes and indicates the dependency of basal hypocotyl curvature on auxin mediated processes. The consistent pattern of initial upregulation along the bottom flank and eventual reversal contradicts the notion that hypocotyls curve negatively gravitropic but are in line with earlier observations that young basal hypocotyls of B. rapa , Linum usitatissimum and other dicots behave similarly to roots and bend positively gravitropic during early growth periods. This behavior reverses as the hypocotyl matures and the orientation of the primary root has been established [ 1 ]. 3.3. Spatio-Temporal Changes during Hypocotyl Curvature The location of tissue and progression of curvature affect gene expression, repressors, and other auxin signaling factors [ 66 ]. The varying transcription of genes in B. rapa roots [ 53 ], indicates transcription differences along the curving hypocotyl; their variance over time should coincide with temporal and spatial changes of curvature and related gene expression. All examined genes exhibited changes in their transcription in the upper and lower flank ( Figure 3 and Figure 5 , Figure 6 and Figure 7 ) of gravicurving hypocotyl over time. The initial upregulation in the lower flank and downregulation along the upper flank is in line with the observed downward curvature in young hypocotyls [ 1 ]. The increased transcription activity along the lower flank is indicative of auxin-induced growth inhibition. As the downregulation of all genes on the upper flank at the beginning of hypocotyl curvature (four hours) is greater than the upregulation on the bottom side, the differential ratio (up/down, Figure 5 and Figure 6 ) is high and suggests auxin flow to the lower flank. At the midpoint of hypocotyl curvature at 11 h [ 1 ], the auxin asymmetry reaches its maximum and is likely associated with the tipping point [ 3 ] that leads to the subsequent reversal of curvature at about 35 h for PIN1 and IAA5, and 30 h for PIN3 and ARG1. This sequence coincides with the reversal of hypocotyl downward curvature. The transition in gene transcription implies a shift in either lateral auxin transport or auxin sensitivity, possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species or reductive factors [ 67 ]. The significance of this observation is the ensuing change of curvature from positive to negative gravitropic and that it reaches the typical negative gravitropic curvature that is characteristic of mature hypocotyls. Although the transcription profile 48 h after reorientation was not equal on both flanks, the data suggest that the hypocotyl curvature for the different curvatures rely on the same genes but does not address what causes the reversal of auxin sensitivity over time. However, the effect of auxin levels and ensuing gene transcription will also be affected by the cessation of the ability to elongate; therefore, the maturing tissue no longer responds to changes in auxin-mediated development and the reversal in hypocotyl curvature, i.e., negative gravitropism, depends on tissue that is still expanding. The high-resolution SPGE analysis revealed changes in the transcription profile within the curving tissue ( Figure 6 ). The greatest polarity was associated with the central probes (#2 and #5), therefore SPGE profiling is sensitive to spatial differentiation and expansion. The differences between the central and distal probes illustrate both auxin effect and the spatial dependency of gene activation. Future work will investigate if vertically oriented hypocotyls show maturation-dependent changes in gene transcription. The combination of sensitivity, age, and stimulation (auxin) are likely to control (differential) elongation Despite the overall similarity in the assessment of transcription activities, there were differences between the individual genes and sampling positions. Notably PIN1 and PIN3 showed its lowest transcription after four hours at the apical-most upper position and increased without reaching a minimum at 11 h. The same trend prevailed for IAA5 and ARG1 ( Figure 6 ). Possibly, the apical region is less sensitive for curvature, and thus, inhibition. Another consideration relates to the expression of PIN3 and ARG1 in the endodermis [ 46 ] and their involvement in shoot gravitropism [ 43 ] via polar auxin transport. Therefore, the signal may not have been maximal as SPGE sampling clearly involved cortical tissue. Nonetheless, the polarity of all examined genes was higher for SPGE than for tissue analyses ( Figure 5 vs. Figure 6 ), supporting SPGE-based sampling as a valuable tool for the study of physiological processes. IAA5 is considered a gravitropic response indicator as its distribution reflects gravity-induced auxin asymmetry [ 68 ]. IAA5 had the highest transcription levels (lowest Cq values, Figure 4 ). However, its lateral polarity was less than that of the other examined genes. 3.4. Comparison of Root Tip and Hypocotyl The root tips of horizontally oriented seedlings reach a vertical position after four hours of reorientation [ 1 ]. Therefore, lateral auxin gradients are likely to not exist at longer times. The comparison between root tip tissue and SPGE sampling shows that both sampling methods detect a similar change in transcription, but tissue samples show larger signals during curvature. Since no concave or convex tissues were sampled, the signal likely reflects a general increase in transcription. SPGE shows a similar increase, but after a significant delay. Both sampling profiles showed a comparable order of activation. The notable exception was IAA5, which was substantially higher in the tissue and remained unchanged in SPGE samples. This discrepancy may stem from a higher mRNA quantity in tissue that was not represented in SPGE extracts such as the developing stele or epidermis [ 69 ]. The rapid increase in all transcripts in tissue samples occurred over a longer time in SPGE samples. This increase is not related to curvature but likely illustrates the increase in transcription as the root ages or sensitivities change during vertical orientation. Changes in sensitivity with age have been documented previously [ 1 , 70 , 71 ] and indicate that despite the lack of curvature-specific differences, root tips are a suitable reference for hypocotyl-related changes in gene transcription. This notion likely extends to other species that show a biphasic response in hypocotyl curvature. Equally important is the confirmation that the positive and negative hypocotyl curvature depends on similar hormonal signaling mechanisms as root curvature. 3.5. Comparison of RNA Extraction Techniques Although the yield of tissue extraction is about 400 times the yield of SPGE extraction (see Section 2.1 ), SPGE data show greater polarity than tissue extraction ( Figure 5 , Figure 6 and Figure 7 ). The large tissue quantity not only diminishes the differential signal but is problematic as large quantities make differential sampling unreliable. The much higher spatial resolution of SPGE avoids such complications, is accurate, and can readily and repeatedly determine RNA profiles without purification [ 61 ]. Overall, the data show that SPGE allows for mRNA profiling at high spatial resolution that is useful for the determination of transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli in plants and other biological systems.",
