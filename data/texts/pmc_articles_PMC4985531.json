    "Abstract": "Abstract Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 10 7 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.

Experiment 2: Effects of 15 Weeks of Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy and 8 Weeks of High-Fat Diet on Marrow Adiposity and Cancellous Bone Histomorphometry in ob/ob Mice The effects of rAAV-Lep pretreatment and high-fat diet on body weight and on cancellous bone in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 2 . Body weight was higher in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. Body weight was also higher in ob/ob mice fed high fat compared to ob/ob mice fed regular diet and rAAV-Lep treatment resulted in lower body weight. Cancellous bone area fraction, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number were higher and trabecular spacing was lower in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. rAAV-Lep treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower cancellous bone area fraction and trabecular thickness. Significant differences in trabecular number or trabecular spacing were not detected with treatment in the ob/ob mice. With the exception of trabecular thickness, which was lower, significant differences between WT mice and rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice fed regular diets were not detected for any of the remaining cancellous endpoints evaluated.

    "Conclusion": "Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were heavier and had increased MAT in distal femur metaphysis compared to WT mice. Consumption of high-fat diet resulted in increased body weight in both WT mice and ob/ob mice but increased MAT and cancellous bone in WT mice only. rAAV-Lep treatment decreased MAT in ob/ob mice. The reduction in MAT in rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice was accompanied by increases in osteoblast-lined and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter but not by an increase in cancellous bone. Continuous and once daily intracerebroventricular administration of leptin were similarly effective in reducing MAT in long bones of ob/ob mice ( 23 , 24 , 36 , 37 ). Based on lower adipocyte number and size and increased concentration of apoptosis marker caspase-3 in bone marrow adipocytes, the reduction in MAT was likely due to a combination of reduced adipocyte differentiation, increased fat oxidation, and increased adipocyte apoptosis. A similar reduction in MAT was observed following subcutaneous leptin administration ( 36 ). In normal female rats, hypothalamic delivery of rAAV-Lep was shown to maintain lower body weight, WAT weight, and serum leptin levels (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 1.0 ± 0.1 ng/ml) for at least 18 weeks following vector administration. By contrast, rAAV-Lep transiently reduced MAT; MAT levels were reduced at 5 weeks but returned to normal levels by 10 weeks following vector administration ( 38 ). Also, hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy was ineffective in lowering MAT in ovariectomized rats ( 39 ). In the present study, MAT levels in rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice, evaluated 15 and 30 weeks following vector administration, were much lower than age-matched ob/ob controls and comparable to WT mice in Experiment 2. These findings suggest that (1) while very important, the physiological actions of leptin on MAT are primarily manifested at low hormone levels and (2) hyperleptinemia has little further effect on MAT. If correct, this could help explain why some studies fail to detect a relationship between blood leptin levels and MAT ( 1 ). The findings regarding the actions of leptin on MAT are remarkably similar to the actions of the hormone on bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Whereas hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy corrected the skeletal abnormalities in ob/ob mice, it had minimal long-term impact on bone in rodents capable of producing leptin ( 16 , 18 , 28 , 39 ). It was initially hypothesized that the complex skeletal phenotype of ob/ob mice was due to opposing actions of peripheral and central leptin on bone formation ( 40 , 41 ). However, subcutaneous and intracerebroventricular delivery of leptin were found to similarly increase bone formation in ob/ob mice ( 36 ). Additionally, long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was shown to normalize bone microarchitecture in ob/ob mice; specifically, increasing hypothalamic leptin levels resulted in increased femur length and total femur bone volume but decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra ( 28 ). These latter findings imply that, in addition to increasing longitudinal bone growth, delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus results in increased bone formation as well as increased bone resorption. Thus, an imbalance between bone formation and resorption related to local environment (e.g., precursor cell populations, mechanical loads, paracrine factors, etc.) potentially explains the contrasting phenotypes that have been identified in bones of the limb and spine in ob/ob mice ( 41 ). Bone- and bone compartment-specific changes in microarchitecture in response to hormonal regulators of bone metabolism and mechanical loading environment are not unique to leptin. For example, by regulating longitudinal and radial bone growth and bone turnover balance, estrogens, and androgens contribute to sexual dimorphism of the skeleton. In this regard, administration of estrogen to growing ovariectomized rats results in shorter bones with lower total bone mass but higher site-specific cancellous bone volume ( 42 ). Ovariectomized rats also experience increased MAT expansion ( 39 ). ob/ob mice of both genders are hypogonadal due to reduced GnRH secretion ( 43 ), a defect that is reversed following leptin treatment ( 25 , 29 ). Thus, it is possible that hypogonadism contributes to MAT expansion in ob/ob mice. Expansion of MAT during caloric restriction in WT mice was associated with increased circulation of glucocorticoids, while caloric restriction resulted in a further increase in the already high levels of MAT in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice ( 1 , 18 ). These findings provide evidence that multiple factors, including leptin, regulate MAT levels. As previously mentioned, short-duration delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus increased bone formation ( 36 ). Similarly, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased serum osteocalcin levels and osteoblast perimeter in lumbar vertebra of ob/ob mice ( 16 , 44 ). In the present study, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter in distal femur metaphysis in ob/ob mice 30 weeks following vector administration. These findings indicate that leptin promotes higher levels of bone formation prior to and following restoration of normal body weight and bone mass in ob/ob mice ( 28 ). The increased cancellous bone volume fraction observed at selected skeletal sites (lumbar vertebrae) in ob/ob mice was initially attributed to increased bone formation, suggesting that leptin was antiosteogenic ( 45 ). However, subsequent studies consistently reported decreased bone formation in ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, and increased bone formation following intracerebroventricular delivery of leptin, leptin gene therapy, or subcutaneous administration of leptin in ob/ob mice ( 16 , 37 , 44 ). Leptin signaling-deficient ( ob/ob and db/db ) mice have normal or increased osteoclast number but exhibit evidence for impaired osteoclast function ( 16 , 18 ). As a consequence, these mice exhibit impaired skeletal maturation due to defective resorption of calcified cartilage. Specifically, the high cancellous bone volume fraction represents mild osteopetrosis. In the present study in ob/ob mice, rAAV-Lep resulted in increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. Thus, the failure to detect an increase in cancellous bone volume fraction in the femur metaphysis in response to higher leptin levels is likely due to parallel increases in bone formation and bone resorption. High MAT levels in ob/ob mice are associated with low cancellous bone turnover ( 16 ). In the present study, rAAV-Lep resulted in increases in osteoclast-lined perimeter as well as osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and greatly reduced MAT with minimal change in cancellous bone area fraction. High MAT levels are not unique to leptin deficiency. Growth hormone deficiency in rats and mice induced by hypophysectomy or deletion of the gene for growth hormone, respectively, is also associated with high MAT and low bone turnover. In the case of growth hormone deficiency, parathyroid hormone was found to increase bone formation in hypophysectomized rats without impacting MAT levels, demonstrating that bone formation induced by bone anabolic agents is not suppressed by high levels of MAT ( 33 ). Similarly, although bone formation was increased, the absence of MAT in kit W/W-v mice did not protect against ovariectomy-induced bone loss ( 46 ). Taken together, these findings suggest that bone resorption as well as bone formation can be impacted during changes in MAT levels and interventions that target MAT may not necessarily change bone turnover balance. A positive association between body weight and bone mass was observed in ob/ob as well as WT mice ( 30 , 47 ). However, leptin appears to sensitize the skeleton to bone mechanical loading. This may explain why leptin-deficient mice have a low total bone mass even though they are morbidly obese and why the massive weight loss in ob/ob mice following leptin treatment is actually associated with a net increase in bone mass ( 28 ). Conditional knockout of the leptin receptor in bone marrow stromal cells has been reported to result in local increases in osteogenesis and decreased adipogenesis ( 48 ). It is difficult to reconcile these findings with the skeletal phenotype of leptin receptor-deficient mice ( 16 , 49 ) or with the present results demonstrating that increasing hypothalamic leptin levels profoundly reduces MAT levels. Evidence that factors secondary to leptin deficiency are responsible for the discrepancy, as suggested by Yue et al., are presently lacking and correction of many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency (e.g., hyperglycemia), rather than improving, actually worsens the skeletal phenotype of ob/ob mice ( 18 ). Also inexplicable by Yue et al. is the finding that adoptive transfer of leptin receptor-deficient db/db bone marrow cells into WT mice recapitulates the low bone formation skeletal phenotype of db/db mice without impacting food intake or weight gain ( 16 ). It is possible that the role of leptin receptors in regulating bone metabolism depends upon stage of stromal cell differentiation ( 50 ), but this requires additional research. A limitation of the present study is that MAT measurements were performed at a single skeletal site and MAT subtypes were not evaluated. The lipid composition and physiological function of MAT can vary with location and/or regulatory factors, such as growth hormone status ( 33 , 51 ). A further limitation of most studies, including the present study, is that they have been performed housing mice at room temperature. Thermoneutral (temperature range where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) in mice ranges from 26 to 34°C ( 52 ). Mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing results in dramatic cancellous bone loss at the femur metaphysis. Interestingly, mice housed at 32°C consumed ~40% less food (fed ad libitum ) but did not differ from room temperature-housed mice in weight ( 53 ). In addition to higher bone mass, mice housed at 32°C had greatly reduced UCP-1 gene expression in brown fat, higher serum leptin, higher MAT levels due to increased adipocyte number, higher bone formation rate to due higher osteoblast perimeter, and lower osteoclast perimeter. These findings suggest that non-shivering thermogenesis substantially influences the association between leptin, MAT, and bone cells. In summary, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy maintained low MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet. The reduction in MAT was accompanied by an increase in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter but not an increase in cancellous bone volume fraction. The increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter suggests that the increase in bone formation was matched by an increase in bone resorption. These findings provide further evidence that a deterministic model where reducing MAT will invariably lead to increased bone volume is not tenable. As a consequence, interventions targeted at reducing MAT may not be an effective strategy for increasing bone mass.",
