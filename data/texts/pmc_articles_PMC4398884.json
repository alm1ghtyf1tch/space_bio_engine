    "Abstract": "Abstract Spaceflight and prolonged bed rest induce deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and bone loss. Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. Vasoconstriction of the femoral PNA was assessed in vitro using norepinephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and myogenic responsiveness. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. Vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the PNA from HU rats was not enhanced through any of the mechanisms tested. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (CON, 86 ± 3%; HU, 48 ± 7% vasodilation) and FMD (CON, 61 ± 9%; HU, 11 ± 11% vasodilation) were attenuated in PNAs from HU rats, while responses to bradykinin were not different between groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP and adenosine were not different between groups. These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.

    "Results": "Animal, Bone, and PNA Characteristics Body mass of HU rats was ∼8% lower than that of CON animals ( Table 1 ). The mass of soleus muscle, a postural hindlimb muscle composed predominantly of slow-twitch type I fibers ( 17 ), was ∼35% lower in HU rats ( Table 1 ), and the soleus muscle-to-body mass ratio was ∼30% lower in HU animals ( Table 1 ). Cortical BMD of the femoral neck was not different between CON and HU rats, while cancellous BMD was lower in HU rats (−18%; Table 1 ). The reduction in soleus muscle mass and soleus muscle-to-body mass ratio validate the efficacy of the 2-wk hindlimb unloading treatment, while the lower cancellous vBMD in the femoral neck confirms the expected bone loss in the animals studied.

Myogenic and Passive Pressure-Diameter Relation There were no differences in the active myogenic vasoconstriction between groups as intraluminal pressure was elevated in the PNA ( Fig. 1 A ).

Vasodilator Responses and mRNA Expression Intraluminal flow through the vessel lumen elicited an endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation in PNAs from CON rats ( Fig. 4 A ). Flow-mediated dilation in PNAs from HU rats was severely blunted relative to that in CON PNAs. The cumulative addition of bradykinin, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, elicited a modest peak dilation (∼25–40%) from both CON and HU rat PNAs; these vasodilator responses were not different between groups ( Fig. 4 B ). Vasodilation to acetylcholine, also an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, was attenuated in PNAs from HU rats relative to that in CON animals ( Fig. 4 C ). Inhibition of the NOS signaling pathway with l -NAME abolished differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation between PNAs from CON and HU rats ( Fig. 5 A ), whereas group differences in acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation remained during COX inhibition with Indo ( Fig. 5 B ). The combined inhibition of the NOS and COX signaling pathways fully suppressed endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the PNA and eliminated group differences ( Fig. 5 C ). PNA eNOS mRNA expression was lower in HU rats relative to that in CON animals ( Fig. 6 A ). However, SOD-1 mRNA expression was not different between groups ( Fig. 6 B ). Endothelium-independent vasodilation to both sodium nitroprusside ( Fig. 7 A ) and adenosine ( Fig. 7 B ) were similar between CON and HU groups. Fig. 4.

    "Conclusion": "Previous research has shown that bone and marrow perfusion is diminished and vascular resistance is elevated during skeletal unloading ( 12 , 52 ), as well as during reloading following a 2-wk period of unloading ( 52 ). The purpose of the present investigation was to assess whether the elevation in bone and marrow vascular resistance is associated with greater vasoconstrictor responsiveness or reduced vasodilator function of the femoral PNA, a resistance artery which is a primary determinant of vascular resistance in long bones ( 6 , 29 ). The data demonstrate that HU does not enhance constriction through any of the vasoconstrictor mechanisms tested. These include receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses [i.e., α-adrenergic receptors ( Fig. 2 ), ET-receptors ( Fig. 3 B ), and V 1 -receptors ( Fig. 3 C )] and non-receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses ( Figs. 1 A and 3 A ). The passive pressure-diameter response was also unchanged by HU ( Fig. 1 B ), indicating that alterations in PNA mechanical properties do not account for the higher vascular resistance in 2-wk unloaded bones. Finally, endothelium-independent vasodilation induced by an exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor ( Fig. 7 A ) and the metabolite adenosine ( Fig. 7 B ) were not impaired by HU. In contrast, endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced through flow ( Fig. 4 A ) and acetylcholine ( Fig. 4 C ), but not bradykinin ( Fig. 4 B ), were attenuated by HU, and this occurred through an impairment of the NOS signaling pathway ( Fig. 5 ). This decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was associated with a reduction in eNOS mRNA expression ( Fig. 6 A ), but not a change in SOD-1 mRNA levels ( Fig. 6 B ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that HU has little effect on smooth muscle vasoconstrictor, vasodilator, or mechanical function in bone resistance arteries and, consequently, indicate that these are not mechanisms for the higher long bone vascular resistance during either unloading or subsequent reloading. HU-induced decrements in NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the bone resistance vasculature are, however, a mechanism that would function to limit bone and marrow perfusion and elevate vascular resistance during unloading and reloading. Changes in the mechanical and chemical milieu of blood vessels are known to alter the functional, structural, and mechanical properties of arteries ( 26 , 27 , 32 ). Hindlimb unloading in the rat induces a headward fluid shift ( 12 , 23 , 47 ) that diminishes arterial pressure in the hindlimb arteries, as well as eliciting both immediate and gradual decreases in bone and marrow perfusion ( 12 ). Such changes in the local environment of bone resistance arteries could impact their intrinsic vasomotor properties and the resistance they generate in regulating bone and marrow blood flow. Previous work has shown that unloading of long bones induces several types of vascular adaptations, including a narrowing of the intraluminal diameter of bone resistance arteries ( 52 ) and rarefaction of the bone microvascular network and supporting infrastructure ( 21 , 38 ). Results from the present study demonstrating a reduction in the maximal PNA diameter ( Table 1 ) are consistent with these observations that the unloading induces a structural remodeling of the bone vascular network. Such structural changes in the bone vasculature, as well as impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the resistance arteries ( Fig. 4 , A and C ), would function to elevate bone vascular resistance and serve to limit the reloading hyperemia and blood flow capacity in bone ( 52 ). Colleran et al. ( 12 ) proposed that bone loss associated with unloading could be impacted by several cardiovascular factors, including 1 ) reduced bone interstitial fluid flow subsequent to decrements in bone and marrow blood flow, and 2 ) impairment of mechanisms directly coupling vascular endothelial cell signaling with bone cell activity (i.e., osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoblasts). In regard to this latter mechanism, release of NO and PGI 2 from vascular endothelial cells can be modulated in response to increases or decreases in blood flow and shear stress ( 9 , 35 ). These molecules not only serve as smooth muscle vasodilator agents, but could act directly on bone cells to elicit changes in bone cell activity. For example, NO is a potent inhibitor of osteoclasts ( 36 ) and promoter of osteoblastic differentiation ( 24 ), while PGI 2 is a powerful inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption ( 10 , 44 ). Such vascular-bone cell interactions could be particularly important in the highly vascularized cancellous bone ( 2 ). In support of this notion, studies have shown that both decreases and increases in cancellous bone volume are associated with impairment and enhancement of bone vascular endothelial function, respectively, with aging ( 46 ), altered estrogen status ( 45 , 48 , 53 ), and low-impact exercise training ( 19 ). Results from the present study of unloading-induced bone loss also demonstrate a relation between cancellous bone mineral density and peak PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( Fig. 8 ). Using inhibitors of endothelial cell signaling mechanisms, the data further indicate that NO and PGI 2 are active vasodilators in the femoral PNA [i.e., NO and PGI 2 account for ∼50% and ∼30% of endothelium-mediated vasodilation, respectively, in CON rats ( Figs. 4 and 5 )]. Inhibition of NO signaling eliminates differences in vasodilation observed in PNAs from CON and HU rats ( Fig. 5 A ), whereas group differences persist during inhibition of PGI 2 ( Fig. 5 B ). These results suggest that the NOS signaling pathway in the bone vasculature is the primary mechanism impaired by unloading, and that the resulting attenuation of NO bioavailability could conceivably impact the bone properties. Fig. 8. Open in a new tab Scattergram showing the relation between cancellous volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) of the femoral neck and peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA) from control and hindlimb unloaded rats. A significant linear relation ( P < 0.05) exists between cancellous BMD and peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Previous work has shown that unloading-induced changes in bone properties occur regionally, with the greatest decrement in BMD occurring in the cancellous bone of the femur in HU rats ( 4 , 30 ). Further, the degree of bone loss that occurs with unloading varies over time ( 4 , 13 , 22 ). Similar observations have been made with regard to the bone and marrow circulation. Colleran et al. ( 12 ) reported that with 10 min and 1 wk of HU, blood flow was lower in almost all regions of the femur, whereas with 4 wk of unloading there were further decrements in perfusion of the femoral diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow. Both the diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow are regions of the femur thought to be perfused primarily via the PNA ( 6 ). Stabley et al. ( 52 ) also reported that following a period of 1 wk of HU, the reloading hyperemia was diminished in only one region of the femur, the distal metaphysis, whereas with 2-wk HU the increase in blood flow with reloading was attenuated in all regions of the femur. These data demonstrate that like the bone itself, there are both regional and temporal effects of unloading on the bone and marrow circulation. In the present study, we have described the effects of unloading on the vasomotor responses of one portion of the bone vasculature at one point in time. Although the PNA is an important site of regulation for long bone and marrow blood flow, it seems likely that regional differences in vascular responsiveness and structure exist in unloaded bones. The bone circulation is one of the most difficult to study in the body, and perhaps for this reason it is also one of the least understood among the various organ systems. Much remains to be learned about adaptations of the bone and marrow vasculature with unloading, and how such changes affect vascular-bone interactions. In contrast to the findings of the present investigation that HU has little effect on the vasoconstrictor properties of resistance arteries in bone, 2 wk of HU and spaceflight have been shown to diminish the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of arteries from various other regions of the body, including the abdominal ( 15 , 18 ) and thoracic aortas ( 18 ), mesenteric resistance arteries ( 3 , 11 ), and resistance arteries from the gastrocnemius muscle ( 14 , 51 ). The one vascular bed that has shown similar functional and structural vascular alterations to that of the femoral PNA is the resistance arteries from the soleus muscle. The soleus muscle is a highly oxidative hindlimb muscle that is tonically active in postural maintenance ( 17 ). Consequently, soleus muscle maintains a relatively high blood perfusion rate during standing ( 12 , 17 , 33 , 52 ), similar to that of the femoral cancellous bone and marrow. Further, both soleus muscle and femoral cancellous bone and marrow blood flow are reduced during postural unloading to approximately one-tenth of that during standing ( 12 , 40 , 52 ). Soleus muscle resistance arteries from 2-wk HU rats show few changes in the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness ( 14 ), but demonstrate impaired NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation, lower eNOS mRNA expression, and reductions in maximal diameter ( 16 , 28 , 39 , 49 ). This decrement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation and remodeling of resistance artery structure underlie elevations in soleus muscle vascular resistance and decreases in the soleus muscle hyperemia during exercise ( 59 ). Thus the putative changes in the mechanical and chemical environment during unloading that drive similar functional and structural adaptations to the resistance vasculature of hindlimb long bones and soleus muscle both result in impaired perfusion rates with reloading. In summary, previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and reloading, which correspond to elevations in vascular resistance ( 12 , 52 ). We hypothesized that the heightened vascular resistance is the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor or diminished vasodilator responsiveness of the bone resistance vasculature. The results demonstrate that vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responsiveness of the PNA smooth muscle cells, as well as the PNA mechanical properties, are not altered by unloading in a manner that would serve to elevate vascular resistance. However, endothelium-dependent vasodilation mediated by flow ( Fig. 4 A ) and acetylcholine ( Fig. 4 C ) were attenuated, and this occurred through an impairment of the vascular endothelial cell NOS signaling pathway ( Figs. 5 and 6 A ). Such changes in the intrinsic vasodilator properties of the bone resistance vasculature, as well as the structural modifications that have been shown to occur in the vasculature of chronically unloaded bone (present study, 21, 52), would function to increase vascular resistance and decrease bone and marrow perfusion in unloaded bones. Such changes in fluid flow through the bone and impairment of endothelial cell NO signaling could contribute to the loss of bone that occurs with unloading, principally in the highly vascularized cancellous bone.",
