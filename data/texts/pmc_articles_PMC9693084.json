    "Abstract": "Abstract Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.

    "Results": "3.1. Optimizing Plant Growth Conditions within the KFT The original purpose of the KFT was to allow astronauts in space to apply fixative or other chemical compounds that are often toxic to biological samples without the use of a microgravity glovebox while maintaining three levels of containment [ 13 ]. For example, KFTs have been used in the past to fix plant samples from a number of spaceflight plant biological experiments [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. The dimensions of the sample compartment of the KFT ( Figure 1 a) were 22.1 mm (diameter) × 62.8 mm (depth). Figure 1.

( i ) Shows coupons inserted into the sample area of the KFTs. ( ii ) Image of pre-actuated KFT. ( iii ) Image of actuated KFT with samples fixed in RNAlater. The general application has been that the astronaut would remove a biological sample from its growth container and transfer the biology to the KFT sample tube. Once the sample was in the KFT, the KFT was sealed, and the fixative was brought into contact with the sample by activating the KFT mechanism [ 15 ]. However, for use in the short timeframes of suborbital flights, the KFTs need to be sealed before flight. This requirement necessitates that the biology be installed into the KFTs as part of a preflight procedure, and the KFT therefore becomes a biology incubator before it is activated to fix the sample. This allows the KFT to serve its purpose of containment safety for the entirety of the suborbital flight. Many previous plant molecular biology spaceflight-related experiments utilized Petri dishes containing a matrix nutrient gel to grow plants on the ISS in a variety of plant growth hardware systems (i.e., BRIC, Biological Research in Canister; ABRS, Advanced Biological Research System; EMCS, European Modular Cultivation System; Veggie). Typically, these plates are taped closed with a porous surgical Micropore ® 3M™ tape, that allows for gas exchange, allowing plants to grow in this configuration for up to fourteen days. To ensure that plants are kept healthy, intact, and experience minimal stress responses when deployed into the KFTs, plants were grown for 7 days on wire mesh coupons suspended into growth media within the 100 mm square Petri plate. The details to construct the deployable coupon are as follows. First, 0.425 mm stainless steel wire mesh (Yikai, UPC: 615435104645) was cut into 22 mm by 62 mm sections, with one short end rounded and bent for holding. The mesh coupons were then autoclaved. The square Petri plates were poured with 10 mL of media, allowed to slightly cool, and then the wire mesh coupons were laid on the solidified media. Finally, 15 mL of media was added to the dish to cover the tops of the coupons. Sterilized seeds were planted approximately 5 mm below the bend in the coupons and were grown vertically to allow roots to grow down the coupons ( Figure 1 a). When ready for placement into KFTs, the media and coupons with plants on the surface were cut out and carefully placed into the KFT ( Supplementary Video Data S1 ). As the internal diameter of the KFT’s sample chamber is the same size as the width of the coupons, the edge of the entire length and base of the coupon is supported by the KFT resulting in an exact fit. Each KFT can hold two coupons, back-to-back, with a total of six 7-day old Arabidopsis plants on each. The bottom chamber of the KFT is filled with ~25 mL of RNAlater and upon actuation of the plunger, RNAlater flows into the sample chamber and the fixation of the plants is immediately initiated [ 14 , 15 ]. A simulation of a simple suborbital flight profile was used in this ground-based study to investigate the responses of plants grown in the KFTs over a time period roughly similar to the flight profiles for both Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. To initiate pre-flight sample preparation, plants on coupons were inserted into the experiment KFTs, the KFTs were sealed by inserting the actuators, and all KFTs were placed in the vertical orientation ( Supplementary Video Data S2 ). This simulates the preparation of biology into the KFTs to be ready for transport and installation into the spacecraft. KFTs were that left in the vertical orientation and not disturbed through the time course were referred to as Quiescent (Q), ( Figure 2 ). After the KFT’s were set up and sealed, they were left to rest for 3 h and 50 min, to model a reasonably long time prior to launch. During actual launch operations, this would the time that the samples would be required to undergo check-out and hand off to vehicle loading procedures for flight operations. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Setup of KFTs for simulated suborbital spaceflight profile. ( a ) Image of KFTs loaded with coupons and actuated after the respective timepoints. ( b ) Four time points of quiescent (Q1–Q4) and one set of treatment on clinostat (C) from Q2 to Q3, seedlings were harvested. Another set of four KFTs were used for comparison with a Petri dish control at Q1. The tissues were fixed in RNAlater overnight and then dissected to roots and leaves, which were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. ( c ) Image of KFT mounted on a 2-D Clinostat. Samples at Q1 (T-10 min, 3 h 50 min after sealing in the KFTs) were actuated and fixed 10 min before the mock launch timepoint (T+0). Additionally, at the T-10 min timepoint, an additional set of four KFTs (Q1A, Q1B, Q1C and Q1D) were actuated to assess the variability and reproducibility of the plant transcriptome simply from being housed for that amount of time in the KFTs. To understand how this methodology differs from the standard Petri dish configuration typically used in spaceflight experiments, the plant transcriptome obtained from each of the four Q1 KFTs (Q1A-D) were compared to the transcriptome from a Petri dish control at the same T-10 min timepoint. Through the remainder of the time course, one KFT was used for each timepoint. Samples Q2, Q3, and Q4 were actuated 4 min, 8 min, and 18 min after T+0 mock launch, which mimicked the flight profile times of boost end / coast start (Q2: T+4 min), coast end (Q3: T+8 min), and landing (Q4: T+18 min), respectively. In addition, a set of samples were placed on a clinostat starting at the Q2 timepoint and fixed at the Q3 timepoint. Here, the KFT was mounted onto a 2-dimensional clinostat parallel to the plane of rotation ( Figure 2 c) and was rotated at 1 rpm for 4 min. Based on the radius (150 mm) of the clinostat, a rotation at 1 rpm would result in a simulated altered microgravity profile of 1.67 × 10 4 g. KFTs were actuated, filling the sample compartment with RNAlater. Plants were allowed to imbibe in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 h. After fixation, seedlings were harvested at each timepoint and each KFT, with the plants on the two coupons within each KFT divided into three biological replicates. For each sample, roots and leaves were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. 3.2. KFT Provides a Suitable Microenvironment for Short-Term Plant Growth Root tissues from four replicate KFTs (Q1A-D) and one Petri dish (Q1P) were analyzed to investigate how plants responded to living within the KFTs for three hours and fifty minutes, in order to assay the effects of preflight sealing into the KFTs. The four KFTs showed a total of 163, 201, 139, and 178 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), when compared to Q1P, the samples taken directly from the Petri plates ( Figure 3 a). The composition of DEGs in the Q1A-D KFT replicates compared to Q1P showed a substantial number of similarities, with 45.7% of DEGs shared by at least two comparisons of KFT versus Q1P Petri plate ( Figure 3 b). In addition, a pairwise comparison between replicates showed an average of only 23 DEGs ( Table 1 ), suggesting that growth conditions with each of the KFTs had little variation. This observation of reproducibility across four individual KFT replicates was also highlighted in the trends observed in the gene expression heatmap ( Figure 3 c, Table S1 ). Across all four KFT replicates, DEGs that were significantly altered in at least one comparison had the same regulatory trend across all the KFTs. This is indicated by the consistent Log fold change coloration in any given gene row of the heatmap. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the list of 244 DEGs upregulated in root tissue grown in KFTs compared to the plate showed an enrichment for ethylene response. Figure 3.

Therefore, an upregulation of ethylene is probable when compared to plants grown on the Q1P Petri plate. In the 115 downregulated DEGs, GO enrichment showed that cellular responses associated with nutrient starvation were repressed. These physiological responses, particularly ethylene accumulation, are commonly observed for plants grown in hardware used during spaceflight [ 19 ]. These data suggest that when compared to the typical Petri dish growth for flight experiments, the KFTs can serve as a containment vessel that allows plants to stay healthy over a several-hour duration as researchers prepare for a suborbital flight. There were gene expression differences in the plants living in the KFTs compared to those living on Petri plates, but that is expected and confirmed by these data. 3.3. Plant Responses to KFTs over Time in a Simulated Suborbital Flight Profile The intent of the time-course experiment that modeled a suborbital flight profile was to investigate plant transcriptomic profiles in the KFTs over the time it takes to complete a suborbital flight, and to access how to best establish ground controls. KFT’s were loaded and sealed at T-4 h prior to the T+0 timepoint. Root tissues (R) harvested from the KFTs actuated at coast start (Q2R), coast end (Q3R), and landing (Q4R) were compared to the control Q1R (T-10 min) In roots, there was an increase in the number of DEGs over time with 123, 183, and 240 DEGs reported for Q2R vs. Q1R, Q3R vs. Q1R, and Q4R vs. Q1R, respectively ( Figure 4 a). Interestingly, more than 50% of all the reported DEGs were unique to each time point ( Figure 4 b). This observation suggests that over time, different genes in the root tissues were engaged or repressed to acclimate growing in the KFT environment. However, trends in the gene expression pattern ( Figure 4 c, Table S2 ), demonstrate genes in all three time points behaved similarly. GO analysis of the upregulated genes showed that genes associated with hypoxia were enriched across all three time points. Analysis of the 256 DEGs including the 199 downregulated genes across all time points showed no significant GO enrichment associated with biological processes ( Figure 4 c). By comparing plant responses in KFTs for different durations to the KFT vs. plate study, it validates that the absence of gas exchange is the dominant response root tissues adapt to. Figure 4. Open in a new tab DEGs detected in at least one comparison of Q2, Q3 or Q4 vs. Q1 in roots. ( a ) Number of DEGs in three comparisons. ( b ) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. ( c ) Heatmap showing expression patterns of 465 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. GO terms of biological processes for 209 induced genes are shown. Hierarchical clustering of heatmap was done using one minus cosine similarity. Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. The red box highlights GO enrichments that are associated with hypoxia responses. In leaf tissues (L), 114 DEGs were identified in the Q2L vs. Q1L comparison, followed by 36 DEGs in Q3L vs. Q1L, and 38 DEGs in Q4L vs. Q1L ( Figure 5 a). These results suggest that the leaf tissues do not have as much of a response to being in the KFTs when compared to the root tissues. The deceasing number of DEGs over time ( Figure 5 a), suggests that leaves might be adapting quickly to the KFT environment. From the number of DEGs seen in each comparison, a large proportion (>90%) were unique to each time-point, with very little overlap ( Figure 5 b). However, looking at the trends of the gene expression heatmap of all DEGs across all time points, several distinct clusters are observed ( Figure 5 c, Table S3 ). In the first cluster, genes were generally upregulated across all the time points and GO enrichment analysis indicated that these set of 49 genes were associated with responses to fructose. The second cluster of 60 genes showed varying regulation of gene expression across the time points with GO enrichments indicating responses to light and photosynthesis. The third cluster showed 70 genes that were generally downregulated across all the time points. GO enrichment showed genes that were downregulated in the third cluster were associated with responses to stimuli. Among these, light associated responses were striking and could be explained by the altered light conditions when plants were inserted into KFTs. The thickness and slight opaqueness of the material used to construct the KFT might cause a reduction of light reaching the plants. Overall, the hypoxic responses in roots and light-related signaling in leaves were the most observable influence on plants when grown in the KFT for a short period of time. Figure 5.

Short-Term Responses of Plants to Gravity Alteration in the KFT To test whether the KFT setup can capture the plant responses to gravity changes with the appropriate controls, the transcriptome of plants grown in the KFTs, placed on the clinostat (C) from the T+0 to the T+8 min timepoint, were compared to a series of different controls. The controls used were: Q1 (T-10 min), Q3 (T+8 min) that has the exact duration of time within the KFTs as (C). Due to the nature of spaceflight experiments, especially in the current early stages of operational developments, such well-timed coordination may not always be feasible. Therefore, the Clinostat (C) sample was also compared to a pooled control of Q1 and Q3, and a combined control of Q1, Q2 and Q3. Clinostat roots (CR) compared to the various root controls (Q3R, Q1R, combined Q1R + Q3R, and pooled Q1R + Q2R + Q3R) revealed that although gene expression trends were similar across all comparisons, using the appropriate controls can better segregate between gravity-related responses from other confounding responses ( Figure 6 ). In root tissues, a total of 369 genes showed significant differential expression in at least one comparison ( Figure 6 a). In this experimental design, Q1 was designated as a sample point before “launch”. The root tissues in CR were in the KFT 18 min longer than Q1R and showed a substantial number of unique DEGs not observed in the other controls, which had GO enrichment mainly involved in temperature stimulus and abiotic stress responses ( Figure 6 a). The overlaps of the significant DEGs between each comparison showed 11 (3%) genes shared by all comparisons, 79 (21.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and 267 (72.4%) genes were unique to Q1R ( Figure 6 b). The gene expression trends showed that the majority of the 369 genes shared similar expression profiles regardless of the control used ( Figure 6 c, Table S4 ). Comparing the gene expression trends between CR versus Q1R and the other comparisons, there is an observable distinction of the foldchange properties of the 228 genes unique to Q1R. In comparing CR to Q3R and when controls were pooled (Q1R + Q3R and Q1R + Q2R + Q3R), these 228 genes no longer met the DEG classification thresholds ( Figure 6 c). These results demonstrated that the KFT setup successfully detected plant responses to gravity changes, though using the appropriate controls can help distinguish between the clinostat response and the likely accumulation of hypoxic stress and/or other environmental stimuli seen when using Q1R as a control ( Figure 4 ). Figure 6. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in roots. ( a ) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for 238 significantly induced genes that are only detected using Q1. ( b ) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. ( c ) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as ( a ). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. In leaves, the variations between the comparisons were not as pronounced as those seen in the roots but a similar trend was observed. A total of 238 DEGs were detected in at least one comparison ( Figure 7 a). Of these DEGs, a substantial number were shared across the various comparisons. The Venn diagram ( Figure 7 b) showed that 8 genes (3.4%) were shared across all comparisons, 127 (53.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and CL vs. Q1L had the highest number of unique genes at 22.3% (53 genes). GO enrichment of the first 65 genes in column one, Figure 7 a, showed processes such as defense-related pathways and the next set of 65 genes showed an enrichment of pathways associated with cell wall and detoxification. These processes are typically observed in gravity-related responses of Arabidopsis in previous spaceflight-related transcriptomic analyses [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. In leaves, the selection of an appropriate control does not seem to have as substantial an impact as roots on capturing the clinorotation response ( Figure 7 c, Table S5 ). Figure 7. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in leaves. ( a ) Heatmap showing significant expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for two clusters of genes. ( b ) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. ( c ) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as ( a ). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. Taken together, when obtaining a well-coordinated control is not feasible, pooling controls from multiple time points can still successfully assay short-term spaceflight responses in plants. Pooled controls similarly reveal gene expression trends and eliminate other confounding responses as do the well-coordinated control, especially in roots which are known to be more sensitive to gas exchange alteration [ 24 , 25 ]. It is expected that the suborbital flight would encounter hyper-g profiles and vibrations that could impact the plant’s transcriptional response. Previously conducted suborbital flight experiments, using 7–12 day old plants grown on the same gel matrix described in this manuscript, have shown that plants adhere well to the gel matrix during the entire flight profile without sustaining any damages [ 26 ]. Thus, although clinorotation of the KFT has its limitations in simulating a suborbital flight, it does allow a glimpse of how researchers would still be able to capture gravity-associated responses using this method.",

In the 115 downregulated DEGs, GO enrichment showed that cellular responses associated with nutrient starvation were repressed. These physiological responses, particularly ethylene accumulation, are commonly observed for plants grown in hardware used during spaceflight [ 19 ]. These data suggest that when compared to the typical Petri dish growth for flight experiments, the KFTs can serve as a containment vessel that allows plants to stay healthy over a several-hour duration as researchers prepare for a suborbital flight. There were gene expression differences in the plants living in the KFTs compared to those living on Petri plates, but that is expected and confirmed by these data. 3.3. Plant Responses to KFTs over Time in a Simulated Suborbital Flight Profile The intent of the time-course experiment that modeled a suborbital flight profile was to investigate plant transcriptomic profiles in the KFTs over the time it takes to complete a suborbital flight, and to access how to best establish ground controls. KFT’s were loaded and sealed at T-4 h prior to the T+0 timepoint. Root tissues (R) harvested from the KFTs actuated at coast start (Q2R), coast end (Q3R), and landing (Q4R) were compared to the control Q1R (T-10 min) In roots, there was an increase in the number of DEGs over time with 123, 183, and 240 DEGs reported for Q2R vs. Q1R, Q3R vs. Q1R, and Q4R vs. Q1R, respectively ( Figure 4 a). Interestingly, more than 50% of all the reported DEGs were unique to each time point ( Figure 4 b). This observation suggests that over time, different genes in the root tissues were engaged or repressed to acclimate growing in the KFT environment. However, trends in the gene expression pattern ( Figure 4 c, Table S2 ), demonstrate genes in all three time points behaved similarly. GO analysis of the upregulated genes showed that genes associated with hypoxia were enriched across all three time points. Analysis of the 256 DEGs including the 199 downregulated genes across all time points showed no significant GO enrichment associated with biological processes ( Figure 4 c). By comparing plant responses in KFTs for different durations to the KFT vs. plate study, it validates that the absence of gas exchange is the dominant response root tissues adapt to. Figure 4.

The red box highlights GO enrichments that are associated with hypoxia responses. In leaf tissues (L), 114 DEGs were identified in the Q2L vs. Q1L comparison, followed by 36 DEGs in Q3L vs. Q1L, and 38 DEGs in Q4L vs. Q1L ( Figure 5 a). These results suggest that the leaf tissues do not have as much of a response to being in the KFTs when compared to the root tissues. The deceasing number of DEGs over time ( Figure 5 a), suggests that leaves might be adapting quickly to the KFT environment. From the number of DEGs seen in each comparison, a large proportion (>90%) were unique to each time-point, with very little overlap ( Figure 5 b). However, looking at the trends of the gene expression heatmap of all DEGs across all time points, several distinct clusters are observed ( Figure 5 c, Table S3 ). In the first cluster, genes were generally upregulated across all the time points and GO enrichment analysis indicated that these set of 49 genes were associated with responses to fructose. The second cluster of 60 genes showed varying regulation of gene expression across the time points with GO enrichments indicating responses to light and photosynthesis. The third cluster showed 70 genes that were generally downregulated across all the time points. GO enrichment showed genes that were downregulated in the third cluster were associated with responses to stimuli. Among these, light associated responses were striking and could be explained by the altered light conditions when plants were inserted into KFTs. The thickness and slight opaqueness of the material used to construct the KFT might cause a reduction of light reaching the plants. Overall, the hypoxic responses in roots and light-related signaling in leaves were the most observable influence on plants when grown in the KFT for a short period of time. Figure 5.

Short-Term Responses of Plants to Gravity Alteration in the KFT To test whether the KFT setup can capture the plant responses to gravity changes with the appropriate controls, the transcriptome of plants grown in the KFTs, placed on the clinostat (C) from the T+0 to the T+8 min timepoint, were compared to a series of different controls. The controls used were: Q1 (T-10 min), Q3 (T+8 min) that has the exact duration of time within the KFTs as (C). Due to the nature of spaceflight experiments, especially in the current early stages of operational developments, such well-timed coordination may not always be feasible. Therefore, the Clinostat (C) sample was also compared to a pooled control of Q1 and Q3, and a combined control of Q1, Q2 and Q3. Clinostat roots (CR) compared to the various root controls (Q3R, Q1R, combined Q1R + Q3R, and pooled Q1R + Q2R + Q3R) revealed that although gene expression trends were similar across all comparisons, using the appropriate controls can better segregate between gravity-related responses from other confounding responses ( Figure 6 ). In root tissues, a total of 369 genes showed significant differential expression in at least one comparison ( Figure 6 a). In this experimental design, Q1 was designated as a sample point before “launch”. The root tissues in CR were in the KFT 18 min longer than Q1R and showed a substantial number of unique DEGs not observed in the other controls, which had GO enrichment mainly involved in temperature stimulus and abiotic stress responses ( Figure 6 a). The overlaps of the significant DEGs between each comparison showed 11 (3%) genes shared by all comparisons, 79 (21.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and 267 (72.4%) genes were unique to Q1R ( Figure 6 b). The gene expression trends showed that the majority of the 369 genes shared similar expression profiles regardless of the control used ( Figure 6 c, Table S4 ). Comparing the gene expression trends between CR versus Q1R and the other comparisons, there is an observable distinction of the foldchange properties of the 228 genes unique to Q1R. In comparing CR to Q3R and when controls were pooled (Q1R + Q3R and Q1R + Q2R + Q3R), these 228 genes no longer met the DEG classification thresholds ( Figure 6 c). These results demonstrated that the KFT setup successfully detected plant responses to gravity changes, though using the appropriate controls can help distinguish between the clinostat response and the likely accumulation of hypoxic stress and/or other environmental stimuli seen when using Q1R as a control ( Figure 4 ). Figure 6. Open in a new tab DEGs of clinostat treatment (C) compared with four different controls in roots.

Genes with −1 < Log2FC < 1, or Padj > 0.05, or no expression data detected in RNA-seq, are filled using gray. GO terms are shown for 238 significantly induced genes that are only detected using Q1. ( b ) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. ( c ) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 369 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as ( a ). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. In leaves, the variations between the comparisons were not as pronounced as those seen in the roots but a similar trend was observed. A total of 238 DEGs were detected in at least one comparison ( Figure 7 a). Of these DEGs, a substantial number were shared across the various comparisons. The Venn diagram ( Figure 7 b) showed that 8 genes (3.4%) were shared across all comparisons, 127 (53.4%) genes were shared by at least two comparisons, and CL vs. Q1L had the highest number of unique genes at 22.3% (53 genes). GO enrichment of the first 65 genes in column one, Figure 7 a, showed processes such as defense-related pathways and the next set of 65 genes showed an enrichment of pathways associated with cell wall and detoxification. These processes are typically observed in gravity-related responses of Arabidopsis in previous spaceflight-related transcriptomic analyses [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. In leaves, the selection of an appropriate control does not seem to have as substantial an impact as roots on capturing the clinorotation response ( Figure 7 c, Table S5 ). Figure 7.

( b ) Overlap between DEGs detected in each comparison. ( c ) Heatmap showing full expression patterns of 238 DEGs detected in at least one comparison. The order of genes is the same as ( a ). Genes with no expression detected in RNA-seq are indicated in gray. Taken together, when obtaining a well-coordinated control is not feasible, pooling controls from multiple time points can still successfully assay short-term spaceflight responses in plants. Pooled controls similarly reveal gene expression trends and eliminate other confounding responses as do the well-coordinated control, especially in roots which are known to be more sensitive to gas exchange alteration [ 24 , 25 ]. It is expected that the suborbital flight would encounter hyper-g profiles and vibrations that could impact the plant’s transcriptional response. Previously conducted suborbital flight experiments, using 7–12 day old plants grown on the same gel matrix described in this manuscript, have shown that plants adhere well to the gel matrix during the entire flight profile without sustaining any damages [ 26 ]. Thus, although clinorotation of the KFT has its limitations in simulating a suborbital flight, it does allow a glimpse of how researchers would still be able to capture gravity-associated responses using this method.",
