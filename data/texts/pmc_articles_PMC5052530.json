    "Abstract": "Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities.",
    "Results": "Overview of Experimental Design To understand if altering the direction in which vibrations are applied plays a role in controlling MSC differentiation and cytoskeletal actin structure and whether LIV amplitude and frequency interact with LIV direction, we applied LIV twice daily for 20 min in either horizontal (h-LIV) or vertical (v-LIV) direction at frequencies of 30 Hz or 100 Hz with acceleration magnitudes of 0.15 g or 1 g. Changes in proliferation (Day 3), ALP activity (Days 1 & 7) and calcium deposition (Days 7 & 14) were assessed. As both the cytoskeleton and nucleo-cytoskeletal connections are involved in specific aspects of LIV mechanosensing 13 , 38 , gene expression profiles of cytoskeletal, nucleo-skeletal, and cell-cell adhesion regulatory proteins were determined via PCR arrays on Days 1, 7, and 14. Additionally, transcriptional levels of genes selected for their role in differentiation were quantified on Day 1. To elucidate morphologic and mechanical adaptations to the distinct LIV signals, the orientation of F-actin was quantified via two-photon confocal microscopy and differences in cellular stiffness between groups were quantified via atomic force microscopy (Day 1). A sample size of n = 6, run as triplicates, was used throughout unless noted otherwise. hBMSC proliferation Fluorescent images of calcein stained cells showed no differences in viable cells between LIV and non-LIV conditions (not shown). On Day 3 of the experiment, cell density was greater (p < 0.001) in all LIV groups when compared to non-LIV controls ( Fig. 1a,b ). For both horizontal and vertical LIV directions, the 100 Hz-0.15 g signal had the greatest effect on proliferation ( Fig. 1a ). When directly comparing h-LIV to v-LIV, cell density was greater for h-LIV than v-LIV for the 100 Hz-0.15 g (12%, p = 0.02) and 100 Hz-1 g (7%, p = 0.03) groups but not for the 30 Hz groups. Cell numbers in dishes exposed to 100 Hz signals had a 42 ± 8% greater (p < 0.001) cell number than those exposed to 30 Hz signals (averaged across loading directions and accelerations). Figure 1.

In all LIV groups, mRNA levels for ALPL and Runx2 were significantly elevated compared to non-LIV controls ( Table 1 ). Compared to non-LIV controls, h-LIV elicited higher gene expression levels, on average, for ALPL (18 ± 4.6%, p < 0.001) and Runx2 (21 ± 3.2%, p < 0.001). The greatest upregulation was observed after horizontal 100 Hz-0.15 g exposure for both ALPL (22%, p < 0.001) and Runx2 (24%, p < 0.001) ( Table 1 ). Table 1.

On Day 1 ( Fig. 2a ) & Day 7 ( Fig. 2b ), alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly elevated in all LIV treated groups when compared to non-LIV controls. Differences between h-LIV and v-LIV treatments were greater on Day 7 than on Day 1. The average difference between h-LIV and v-LIV was 16% (p < 0.001) on Day 7 ( Fig. 2b ) and 9% (p < 0.001) on Day 1 ( Fig. 2a ) with 100 Hz-0.15 g showing the greatest difference (32%, p < 0.001, Fig. 2a,b ). This specific LIV combination also had the greatest elevations in ALP compared to other frequency/acceleration combinations (p < 0.001). Figure 2.

Calcium deposition (mineralization), as quantified by alizarin red staining intensity, was greater in all LIV groups than in non-LIV controls on Days 7 and 14 ( Fig. 2c,d ). Consistent with the hypothesis that the directional application of LIV with respect to cell attachment plane can differentially modulate the osteogenic commitment of hBMSC, differences in calcium deposition between h-LIV and v-LIV groups were significant for both 30 Hz and 100 Hz frequencies measured on Days 7 ( Fig. 2c , p < 0.001) & 14 ( Fig. 2d , p < 0.001). The average difference between h-LIV and v-LIV was 32% ( Fig. 2d , p < 0.001) on Day 14 and 14% ( Fig. 2d , p < 0.001) on Day 7 with 100 Hz-0.15 g showing the greatest difference (32%, p < 0.001, Fig. 2c,d ). LIV direction had a significant effect on hBMSC differentiation; on both Days 7 & 14, the difference in calcification between h-LIV and v-LIV groups was largest in those cultures exposed to 100 Hz-0.15 (difference of 56% on Day 14, p < 0.001). Higher frequency enhanced gene expression induced by both horizontal and vertical LIV Gene arrays using the most effective signal combinations at 30 Hz (30 Hz-1 g) and 100 Hz (100 Hz-0.15 g) showed that genes associated with osteogenic differentiation and matrix maturation - ALPL, BMP2, COL1A1, and RUNX2 - were strongly (>3-fold) upregulated by both h-LIV and v-LIV ( Fig. 3a ). Further, genes associated with cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal organization, ACTN1, CDH11, WHAMM SYNE2 and LaminA/C, were upregulated by more than 3-fold for at least one LIV intervention ( Fig. 3b ). For all upregulated genes, differences in mRNA transcriptional activity between LIV groups and controls became larger as experimental duration progressed from 1d to 7d to 14d, suggesting an accumulative effect of LIV ( Fig. 3a,b ). For all eight genes in this group of greater than 3-fold expression changes and for all three time points considered, 100 Hz LIV signals induced 39 ± 11% (p < 0.001) greater gene expression than 30 Hz signals, demonstrating a frequency-dependent enhancement of hBMSC gene expression. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Normalized transcriptional activity of ( a ) genes associated with osteogenic differentiation and matrix maturation and ( b ) genes associated with cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal organization that were up-regulated by more than 3-fold over non-LIV controls after exposure to either horizontal or vertical LIV at 30 Hz-1 g or 100 Hz-0.15 g on Days 1, 7, and 14. For individual genes in this group, α-actinin (ACTN1), a crosslinking protein known to play a role in stabilizing actin stress fibers 39 , was more highly upregulated (averaged across all time points) by h-LIV than v-LIV at 100 Hz (52%) and 30 Hz (56%). CDH11, a protein that tethers stress fibers to cadherins at cell junctions 40 , had 35% (100 Hz) and 36% (30 Hz) greater transcriptional levels with h-LIV. Gene expression of Nesprin-2 (SYNE2), the actin-binding element of the LINC complex 41 and LaminA/C, a LINC anchoring nuclear matrix protein known to scale with nuclear stiffness 42 , were upregulated by >3-fold only in the horizontal 100 Hz-0.15 g group on Day 14. Averaged across the 3 time points, h-LIV gave rise to greater mRNA activity than v-LIV at both 100 Hz (SYNE2: 41%, LaminA/C: 43%) and 30 Hz (SYNE2: 37% LaminA/C: 33%). Further, the WASP homologue associated with actin, membranes, and microtubules (WHAMM), a nucleation-promoting protein regulating Arp 2/3 complex branched remodeling of both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons 43 , had 21 ± 0.4% greater expression levels with h-LIV than v-LIV at 100 Hz and 15 ± 0.1% at 30 Hz ( Fig. 3b ). For genes upregulated between 2.5 and 3-fold ( Table 2 ), h-LIV promoted 22% greater transcription than v-LIV when averaged over all genes on Days 1 (18%), 7 (21%), and 14 (27%). On Day 14, horizontal 100 Hz-0.15 g LIV produced transcriptional levels that were 41% greater than the average of the other three experimental groups. CD44 44 , BMP-4 45 , and ATF-4 46 have all been associated with osteoblastogenesis and their up-regulation, particularly in the horizontal 100 Hz-0.15 g group at Day 14, highlight the propensity of this specific LIV signal to induce differentiation in hBMSC. Both the upregulation of Rho GTPase CDC42 (consistent with previous data 16 ) and SUN-2, the anchoring element of Nesprin-2 47 , may point towards LIV enhancing cellular structure. Table 2.

Two-photon confocal microscopy was used to visualize cytoskeletal orientation. Visualization of F-actin ( Fig. 4a,c , Fig. S1 ) showed that hBMSCs not subjected to LIV exhibited randomly oriented stress fibers ( Fig. 4a ). h-LIV realigned stress fibers such that their longitudinal axis coincided with the direction of the applied vibration ( Fig. 4b ). In contrast, no change in stress fiber orientation was observed with vertical LIV ( Fig. 4c ). Consistent with the increases in Nesprin-2 and Whamm gene expression, 70% (p < 0.001) of visualized F-actin fibers were aligned within 10 degrees of the vibration axis in h-LIV treated cells.

CDH11, ACTN1, Nesprin-2 and LaminA/C To further test if the enhanced alignment with vibration direction and altered stiffness was mirrored in LIV-responsive genes on Day 1, we used flow cytometry and PCR to probe increases in Cdh11 (as a measure of intra-cellular connectivity at cell edges), Actn1 (cytoskeletal connectivity) and Nesprin-2 (nucleo-cytoskeletal connectivity) protein and transcript levels. LaminA/C was only tested at the transcript level due to sample availability. We found that compared to non-vibrated controls, both h-LIV (Cdh11: 33%, Actn1: 55%, Syne2: 38%; all p < 0.001) and v-LIV (Cdh11: 9%, Actn1: 24%, Syne2: 18%; all p < 0.001) elicited increases in protein levels ( Table 4 ). Further, protein levels in h-LIV treated groups were elevated to a greater degree than in v-LIV groups (Cdh11: 21%, Actn1: 25%, Syne2: 17%; all p < 0.001). Similarly, compared to non-vibrated controls, both h-LIV (Cdh11: 264%, Actn1: 331%, Syne2: 253%; all p < 0.001) and v-LIV (Cdh11: 187%, Actn1: 210%, Syne2: 167%; all p < 0.001) elicited increased gene expression levels ( Table 4 ). Gene expression levels in h-LIV treated groups were elevated to a greater degree than in v-LIV groups (Cdh11: 141%, Actn1: 157%, Syne2: 150%, LaminA/C: 156%; all p < 0.001). The additional augmentation in the expression levels of these proteins suggests that horizontal LIV may generate greater intracellular forces. Table 4.

Relative role of LIV frequency and acceleration Since the loading environment generated by LIV is an outcome of the combination of both LIV frequency and LIV acceleration magnitude, we tested for the relative contributions and possible interactions of these two factors. During early cell proliferation experiments, two-way ANOVA showed a significant interaction between acceleration magnitude and frequency (p < 0.001, across LIV directions). LIV frequency accounted for 59% of the variability in cell density (p < 0.001) while LIV acceleration accounted for only 1% of the total variability (p = 0.02). Later time points also showed significant interaction between acceleration magnitude and frequency in both ALP activity (p < 0.001) as well as mineralization (p < 0.001). While LIV frequency accounted for 27% (p < 0.001) of variability in ALP activity and 49% (p < 0.001) in mineralization, contribution of acceleration magnitude to the total variance was less than 0.1% (NS).",
    "Conclusion": "LIV influences fate selection of MSCs by initiating mechanosensitive signaling pathways in cells, ultimately leading to improvements in musculoskeletal outcomes and adiposity 19 . Here, we asked if the directional application of LIV with respect to the plane of cell attachment differentially modulates MSC differentiation and cytoskeletal remodeling. We found that when applied parallel to the cell attachment plane (h-LIV), LIV was more effective at promoting MSC osteoblastogenesis, ALP activity and mineralization compared to the application of vertical LIV (v-LIV). Accompanying these changes, gene expression of cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal regulatory genes was increased to a greater extent by h-LIV than v-LIV. Consistent with evidence of increased architectural components, AFM measurements revealed that cell stiffness in cells exposed to h-LIV was greater than in those exposed to v-LIV. Irrespective of vibrations direction, 100 Hz LIV combinations were more potent signals than 30 Hz combinations, in particular when combined with the lowest LIV magnitude used here (0.15 g). In support of a greater role for LIV frequency over acceleration in orchestrating the cellular LIV response, there was a significant interaction between LIV frequency and acceleration magnitude with a relatively small role for acceleration magnitude. Together, our data implicate a critical role for the structural configuration of the cytoskeleton for sensing and responding to low-level oscillatory mechanical signals. A conceivable modulator of the cellular response to LIV may be the induced fluid shear stress 22 , 28 . As h-LIV causes two orders of magnitude greater fluid shear stresses than v-LIV 13 , 30 , we cannot exclude the possibility that fluid shear stress may have contributed to the greater magnitude of the h-LIV response observed here. However, not only did we previously fail to find any direct effect of fluid shear stress on the h-LIV response 16 , 29 , our current data also reject the hypothesis of fluid flow driving the LIV response as the signal combination of 100 Hz-0.15 g, inducing the lowest fluid shear (<0.02 Pa) 30 , generated greater responses. Further, increasing the level of fluid shear stress (by increasing the acceleration from 0.15 g to 1 g 30 ) did not potentiate the measured outcomes. Thus, it is unlikely that fluid shear should be considered in the interpretation of our findings. The cell nucleus is mechanically integrated into the cell architecture 48 and participates in mechanosensing and fate selection of MSCs 49 . The physical coupling between the nucleus and cytoskeleton is facilitated via the LINC complex 32 , 50 , comprising Nesprin and Sun proteins 50 that enable the sensing of LIV 13 . Application of LIV activates RhoA signaling to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization, including formation of new focal adhesions and possibly increases the nucleo-cytoskeletal connections at the perinuclear domain 13 . In this regard, formins are increasingly being recognized for playing a role in remodeling of perinuclear architecture. FHOD1 formin 51 , for example, has recently been shown to interact with Nesprin-2 and may be important for nuclear positioning and maintaining coupling between the nucleus and cytoskeleton. Further, LINC complexes may also be involved in formin mediated perinuclear and intranuclear actin dynamics 52 , 53 , suggesting that formins play a yet to be determined role in LINC mediated LIV mechanotransduction. Our data demonstrated that the expression levels of Nesprin-2, the actin-binding element of the LINC complex as well as the nuclear scaffolding protein LaminA/C experienced the greatest upregulation at Day 14 when exposed to horizontal 100 Hz-0.15 g LIV. As MSC mechanosensitivity increases with LIV bouts 13 , the temporal increase in Nesprin-2 and LaminA/C expression may suggest an increased nucleo-cytoskeletal connectivity that may, at least in part, contribute to a more potent MSC mechanoresponse with long-term LIV treatment. We have previously shown that cellular stimulation with LIV activates similar signaling pathways when compared to stretching cells at low frequency (mechanical strain) 13 . The critical difference between LIV (inside-inside) and mechanical strain (outside-inside) appears to be the requirement of LINC connections rather than the signaling pathways activated. More specifically, overexpression of Nesprin KASH domain or siRNA against Sun1/2 does not block strain induced FAK activity 13 but inhibits LIV signaling. Conversely, activation of Akt in response to strain requires Fyn activity 54 while LIV does not utilize this pathway to activate Akt 13 . These findings suggest that both LIV and strain activate similar signaling pathways. Further, the LINC requirement of LIV-induced signaling may suggest that intra-cellular connectivity plays a role in activating conventional signaling pathways in response to LIV. Consistent with previous data 16 was the upregulation of the WAS family of genes with h-LIV. Whamm, a protein involved in remodeling of both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons 43 , was consistently upregulated in all h-LIV groups. As Nesprin is required to maintain strain-induced nuclear alignment 55 , the upregulation of Whamm and Nesprin-2 suggests that the direction of the LIV signal may also play a role in nuclear orientation and its cytoskeletal connection. Moreover, expression levels of Sun2, the Nesprin binding element of LINC complex 47 , were upregulated. As LINC complexes are important for signaling pathways such as βcatenin 56 , it will be important to consider in future studies whether different structural adaptations to LIV direction contribute to how cells respond to subsequent mechanical or biochemical cues. Further, we and others have previously shown defects in cell migration and alignment in response to mechanical challenges like strain using LINC deficient cells in vitro 13 , 32 , 57 . When using siRNA against Sun1/2 or using the DN-Nesprin KASH domain, LIV cannot activate RhoA. It may therefore be possible that limiting LINC connectivity may also eliminate the h-LIV induced cell orientation demonstrated here. Further investigation of the effects of LINC deficiency on the LIV-induced cytoskeletal realignment will provide important clues towards elucidating LIV mechanotransduction. Alpha-actinin supports higher-order cytoskeletal stress fiber formation 39 . CDH11 directs adherent junction formations during cell-cell bridging and can interact with structural proteins including α-actinin 40 . Considering that both ACTN1 and CDH11 were more highly upregulated in h-LIV groups in which cytoskeletal orientation aligned with the loading axis, the concomitant increase in these two proteins by h-LIV may suggest a coordinated effort towards regulating cellular alignment and cell-to-cell interaction. Interestingly, SUN2 has recently been implicated in mediating cell-cell contact in keratinocytes 58 . As h-LIV enhances gap junctional communication in MLO-Y4 osteocyte like cells 29 , the enhanced expression in CDH11 and SUN2 in h-LIV groups may point towards an enhancement in LIV induced cell-to-cell interaction. If true, then cells exposed to h-LIV may achieve their more highly organized cellular architecture through the upregulation of these structural genes. Identification of cellular elements involved in sensing and responding to extremely low levels of mechanical signals may prove critical towards developing effective mechanically based musculoskeletal treatments without side-effects. Our work here focusing on cellular and molecular responses when exposed to low intensity vibrations emphasizes the importance of the cell’s cytoskeletal and nucleo-cytoskeletal elements in transforming LIV signals into a biological response in human mesenchymal stem cells.",
