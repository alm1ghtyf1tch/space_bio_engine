    "Abstract": "Abstract The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.

    "Results": "Structural features of MSGs Figure 1 displays all sulfated glycans screened in inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains. The MSGs examined comparatively to heparin, unfractionated heparin (UFH) ( Fig. 1A ), include 3 fucosylated chondroitin sulfates (FucCSs) from sea cucumbers, 3 sulfated fucans (SFs) from 2 sea cucumbers and 1 sea urchin, and 1 sulfated galactan (SG) from a red alga. The species and structures of the FucCS series are Isostichopus badionotus (IbFucCS) {→3)-β-GalNAc4,6S-(1→4)-β-GlcA-[(3→1)Y]-(1→} n , where Y = α-Fuc2,4S (96%), or α-Fuc4S (4%) ( Fig. 1C ), Holothuria floridana (HfFucCS) {→3)-β-GalNAc4,6S-(1→4)-β-GlcA-[(3→1)Y]-(1→} n , where Y = αFuc2,4S (45%), α-Fuc3,4S (35%), or α-Fuc4S (20%) ( Fig. 1D ) and Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) {→3)-β-GalNAcX-(1→4)-β-GlcA-[(3→1)Y]-(1→} n , where X = 4S (80%), 6S (10%) or nonsulfated (10%), Y = α-Fuc2,4S (40%), α-Fuc2,4S-(1→4)-α-Fuc (30%), or α-Fuc4S (30%) ( Fig. 1E ). The other glycans are the SG from Botryocladia occidentalis (BoSG) [3-β-Gal2R 1 4R 2 -(1→4)-α-Gal2R3R-(1→] n in which R = SO 3 − or OH, R 1 and R 2 = 66% and 33% sulfation, respectively ( Fig. 1B ), the SF from the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus (LvSF) ( Fig. 1G ), [→3)-α-Fuc2,4S-(1→3)-α-Fuc2S-(1→3)-α-Fuc2S-(1→3)-α-Fuc4S-(1→] n , the SF from the sea cucumber H. floridana (HfSF) ( Fig. 1H ), [→3)-α-Fuc2,4S-(1→3)-α-Fuc-(1→3)-α-Fuc2S-(1→3)-α-Fuc2S-(1→] n , and from I. badionotus (IbSF) ( Fig. 1F ), [→3)-α-Fuc2,4S-(1→3)-α-Fuc2S-(1→3)-α-Fuc2S-(1→3)-α-Fuc-(1→] n .

Structural integrity and molecular weights All sulfated glycans studied here are natural products isolated from digestions of different biological sources. The structural integrity and reliable purity levels of all these sulfated glycans was confirmed by 1D 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy ( Fig. 2A and B ), as they show typical spectral profiles as reported previously ( Tandon et al. 2021 for UFH, Farias et al. 2000 for BoSG, Chen et al. 2011 for IbFucCS, Dwivedi et al. 2021 for PpFucCS, Shi et al. 2019 for HfFucCS, Chen et al. 2012 for IbSF, Pomin et al. 2005 for LvSF, and Shi et al. 2019 for HfSF). The purified MSGs were further analyzed by 22% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) ( Fig. 2C and D ) to understand polydispersity distribution and to correlate the different molecular weights (MWs) of MSGs with their anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. Their MW distribution was assessed in comparison with mammalian GAGs of known MWs. The series of holothurian FucCS showed bands between ~60 and ~100 kDa ( Fig. 2C ). The MW distribution of the homopolysaccharides composed of galactose (BoSG) and fucose (IbSF, HfSF, and LvSF) indicates higher MW for these polymers, ≥100 kDa ( Fig. 2D ). The MWs of the series of FucCS and SF/SG are in accordance with previous publications ( Shi et al. 2019 ; Dwivedi et al. 2021 ; Zoepfl et al. 2021 ), confirming therefore the structural integrity.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Delta strains and cytotoxicity of MSGs MSGs were examined for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into HEK-293T-hACE2 cells using a baculovirus pseudotyped with S-proteins of WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) ( Fig. 3A and Table S1 ) and Delta (B.1.617.2) ( Fig. 3B and Table S2 ) strains and encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The IC 50 values of the MSGs ( Table 1 ) demonstrated generally similar activity of heparin (IC 50 = 0.6 mg/L) against the Wuhan strain (range of 0.1–1.0 mg/L) and generally (slightly) weaker activity than heparin (IC 50 = 0.2 mg/L) against the Delta strain (range of 0.1–5.9 mg/L). In the cytotoxicity assays (trypan blue exclusion) on HEK-293T-hACE2 cells, all tested MSGs, except HfSF, exhibited no significant cell death even at the highest concentration of 50 mg/L and 60 h of continuous exposure as compared to the mock-treated cells ( Fig. 3B and Table S3 ).

UFH and MSGs were assayed for their potential to inhibit GFP transduction in HEK-293T-hACE2 cells infected with pseudotyped SARS-Cov-2 S-proteins of A) Wuhan-Hu-1 and B) Delta (B.1.617.2) strains. Normalized values from the assay were analyzed by the nonlinear regression to fit a dose–response curve using the least-squares method, considering each replicate value as an individual point. The plotted curve shows percentage of SARS-CoV-2 WT and Delta inhibition in a (log) concentration-dependent manner.

Concluding remarks In this study, 7 MSGs were examined, comparatively to heparin, regarding their capacities to block 2 strains, WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2), of SARS-CoV-2. Although each sulfated glycan showed its own inhibitory capacity, the inhibitory activities of the MSGs strains were generally similar and (slightly) weaker, respectively, against Wuhan and Delta strains. No correlation between structural features (sulfation pattern, MW, monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage, and/or anomeric configuration) and anticoronaviral activity was observed.
