    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple “skin microbiome.” We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. elegans surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including Enterobacter sp. JUb101 , are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal’s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts. IMPORTANCE The genetic model organism C. elegans has recently emerged as a tool for understanding host–microbiome interactions. Nearly all of these studies either focus on pathogenic or gut-resident microbes. Little is known about the existence of native, nonpathogenic skin microbes or their function. We demonstrate that members of a modified C. elegans model microbiome, mCeMbio, can adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. We combine a novel micro-swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from relatively unperturbed C. elegans , and physiological assays to demonstrate microbially mediated protection of the skin. This work serves as a foundation to explore wild C. elegans skin microbiomes and use C. elegans as a model for skin research. KEYWORDS: Caenorhabditis elegans , skin microbiota, microbiome, 16S RNA",
    "Results": "A skin swab protocol reveals that abundant mCeMbio bacteria persist on the C. elegans surface We sought to directly identify the existence of a resident skin microbiome on the C. elegans cuticle. However, existing microbiological techniques on the nematode are designed to isolate the entirety of the animal’s microbiota rather than skin microbes. We postulated that the entire microbiota consists of gut-resident and surface-resident microbes and that these parts can be separated with varying intensities of surface-washing steps ( Fig. 1A ). For instance, surface-sterilization, hereafter referred to as “bleaching,” removes all skin bacteria and isolates gut-resident bacteria ( Fig. 1A ). Moreover, we hypothesize that animals with more skin-resident bacteria will demonstrate larger decreases in bacterial counts following bleaching. Using a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, we assessed the existence of surface-adherent microbes on animals reared on OP50 or mCeMbio. First, we observe greater CFUs from animals reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50 ( Fig. 1B ). We also observe no significant difference between the number of CFUs from whole animal lysates that were serially washed or bleached after being reared on OP50 (<10 3 bacteria per worm, Fig. 1B ). However, we observe a significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (<10 4 bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>10 6 bacteria per worm). From these data, we find that animals reared on mCeMbio, but not OP50, harbor skin-resident bacteria. Moreover, to account for free-living bacteria that are not in contact with the skin, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants after a series of washes. We observe that there are OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria present in the supernatant after washing three times, which might reflect transient gut or skin microbes that have been shed, and highlight the limited extent of these methods for identifying skin-resident microbes.

Inspired by existing methods used to identify skin microbes on the surface of amphibians ( 40 – 43 ), we created a microscopic nematode-sized skin swab. This reusable glass tool is swabbed across the length of each animal ( Fig. 1C ). To eliminate non-adherent, free-living microbes and enrich for putative skin-resident microbes, we compare unwashed animals (“crawl”) to animals that have been washed once or three times. As a negative control, we include animals that have been bleached. Swabs from animals reared on OP50 indicate that OP50 grows from lawns and unwashed animals, but even washing once eliminates all skin-associated OP50 bacteria ( Fig. 1D ; Fig. S1A and C). Specifically, growth curves of OP50 from singly (1X) and triply (3X) washed animals are indistinguishable from the swabs from bleached animals ( Fig. 1E ). Swabs from animals reared on mCeMbio indicate that viable bacteria can be isolated from lawns and unwashed animals as well as animals that have been washed up to three times ( Fig. 1F ; Fig. S1B and D). Growth curves of mCeMbio from animals washed up to three times had ~7 fold higher levels of bacteria compared to bleached animals ( Fig. 1G ). These findings suggest that there are significant populations of adherent mCeMbio bacteria on the C. elegans cuticle that are removed by standard bleach-based surface-sterilization protocols. Surface sterilization alters the relative proportion of mCeMbio bacteria, suggesting distinct surface-resident communities We sought to define the species of mCeMbio bacteria that reside on the C. elegans cuticle and determine whether they are distinct from the microbiota of the gut and the surrounding environment. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on bleached C. elegans , serially washed C. elegans , and their bacterial lawns. In two separate experiments, we discovered that the bacterial communities of bleached animals have a microbiota that is distinct from those of animals that have been serially washed. In bleached animals, we observed significantly higher levels of Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, while unbleached animals contain more Enterobacter sp . JUb101 and Sphingobacterium multivorum BIGb0170 ( Fig. 2A through C ). Despite significant differences between the relative abundance of bacteria across experiments 1 and 2 (Fig. S2A through C), we observe consistent differences in microbiota composition of bleached and serially washed animals, both of which are distinct from bacterial lawns ( Fig. 2E and F ). These data suggest that bacterial communities of bleached animals are significantly different than those of serially washed animals, as evidenced by Bray–Curtis distances (PERMANOVA, Fig. 2G and I ). Furthermore, within-sample alpha diversity, expressed as the Shannon index, of each treatment group is similar, but mCeMbio bacterial lawns display greater diversity than bleached or serially washed C. elegans in experiment 2 ( Fig. 2H and J ). Our data suggest that the composition of the C. elegans skin microbiome is stable over time; we observe that only one bacterial species shows a significant change in abundance between 2 and 8-day-old washed (unbleached) animals, while the microbiome composition between 2 and 8-day-old bleached animals shows reduction in only two species (Fig. S2D and E). Collectively, we suggest that the microbiota of C. elegans with an intact skin microbiota is distinct from the microbiota of the C. elegans gut and further distinct from the environment on which the animals were raised. Specifically, we hypothesize that species more abundant in bleached animals (JUb19 and MYb71) are more gut-specific, whereas species more abundant in serially washed animals (JUb101 and BIGb0170) are more skin-specific.

Specific mCeMbio microbes associate with the C. elegans cuticle Informed by 16S relative abundance data, we sought to identify the effects of bleaching or serial washes on animals reared on JUb19 or JUb101. JUb101 is the only predominantly skin-resident microbe on which C. elegans develop at similar rates to those of OP50 and mCeMbio (( 33 ) and our observations), and JUb19 is the gut-resident microbe with the highest relative abundance ( Fig. 2C and D ). As in Fig. 1 , we performed CFU analysis on the microbes of interest in this study. We observe more CFUs from lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb101 (>10 6 bacteria per worm) than lysates of serially washed animals reared on JUb19 (<10 5 bacteria per worm) ( Fig. 3A ). There is no statistically significant difference between the number of CFUs from lysates of serially washed or bleached animals reared on JUb19, although JUb19 is still found on the surface. This is indicated by ~10 4 CFU per worm found in and on serially washed animals, compared to the ~10 2 CFU per worm found in bleached animals ( Fig. 3A ). Conversely, in animals raised on JUb101, there is a statistically significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (~10 2 bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>10 6 bacteria per worm), indicating the presence of JUb101 as a persistent and abundant skin-resident microbe that is removed with surface-sterilization protocols, but not serial washes ( Fig. 3A ). To account for free-living bacteria that are loosely attached to the cuticle or transient within the worm, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants following serial washes. We observe that JUb101 and JUb19 are both present in these supernatants, but in lower abundance when compared to washed groups. Fig 3.

To directly compare JUb19 and JUb101 as putative gut and skin-resident microbes, respectively, we swabbed animals reared on JUb19, JUb101, or CBX151. We include CBX151 ( Leucobacter celer subsp. astrifaciens , Verde1) as a control bacterium that is known to strongly adhere to the C. elegans cuticle ( 44 ). We hypothesized that the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed skin-resident bacteria should more closely resemble those of CBX151 and mCeMbio animals ( Fig. 1G ), whereas the patterns observed in the growth curves of swabbed gut-resident bacteria should resemble those of OP50 ( Fig. 1E ). As expected, swabs from animals reared on CBX151 grow regardless of the number of washes ( Fig. 3B ). After 72 hours of growth, no discernable differences between swabs from animals that were unwashed (“crawl”), washed once, or washed thrice after exposure to CBX151 were observed ( Fig. 3C ; Fig. S3A and B). Similarly, swabs from animals reared on JUb101 grow regardless of the number of washes ( Fig. 3D ). After 72 hours of growth, swabs from JUb101-reared animals that have been washed once are not distinct from those of unwashed JUb101-reared animals, but are distinct from those of bleached animals ( Fig. 3E ; Fig. S3C and D). Conversely, swabs from animals reared on JUb19 indicate that bacterial growth from unwashed “crawl” animals is distinct from animals washed once or thrice ( Fig. 3F and G ). Swabs from JUb19 animals washed once or thrice are indistinguishable from swabs of bleached animals ( Fig. 3G ; Fig. S3E and F). Together, the patterns observed in JUb101 growth curves resemble those of CBX151, suggesting that JUb101 is also likely a cuticle-resident microbe. CeMbio bacteria promote wildtype and mutant C. elegans cuticle integrity Given that mCeMbio contains both skin- and gut-resident bacteria, with variable strengths of attachment on the nematode cuticle, we sought to observe a potential role for skin-adherent bacteria. We hypothesized that bacteria associated with the cuticle (JUb101, BIGb0170, and CBX151 as a known skin-adherent control) would protect animals from noxious environments more than gut-associated ones (JUb19 and MYb71). To test this, we performed a cuticle resistance assay by treating animals with a harsh (5%) bleach solution ( Fig. 4A ). In this assay, the time to burst is a readout of cuticle integrity and a potential indication of the protective roles that bacteria may have on worm physiology ( 45 , 46 ). We found that wild-type animals reared on CBX151 and mCeMbio community take significantly longer to burst compared to OP50 controls and therefore exhibit greater cuticle resistance ( Fig. 4B ). Animals were also reared on mCeMbio isolates individually, and we observed a range of impacts on cuticle integrity. Some bacterial species, including gut-resident Ochrobactrum MYb71, significantly promoted cuticle integrity with longer times to burst. Other bacteria, including the skin-associated JUb101 and gut-associated JUb19, did not alter animal burst times compared to OP50. Sphingomonas JUb134 was the only mCeMbio strain to significantly decrease host cuticle integrity, further supporting that most mCeMbio strains are nonpathogenic in this context ( 33 ). However, neither JUb101 nor JUb19 consistently change C. elegans cuticle burst time on their own ( Fig. 4B ). This suggests that interspecies interactions present in mCeMbio may promote cuticle protection or the N2 wildtype C. elegans strain lacks sensitivity in this assay and masks the subtle impact on the cuticle.

To test this, we assessed how these bacteria affect animals with disrupted cuticle structures, thereby sensitizing the assay. We tested animals with mutations in cuticle-related genes: bus-8, dpy-8, srf-3, and dpy-10 (Fig. S4A; Table S1). All genes are known to affect cuticle integrity. Bus-8 is predicted to encode a glycosyltransferase, enabling proper cuticle molts and leading to disordered epidermal morphogenesis in strong mutants ( 26 , 45 ). Dpy-8 and dpy-10 are collagen genes that, upon disruption, cause loss of cuticular annuli structures ( 27 ). Srf-3 encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter, and mutants have altered cuticle surface compositions that confer biofilm resistance ( 28 ). Previous studies have demonstrated bus-8 (e2698 ) mutants as more sensitive ( 45 ) in the cuticle resistance assay, while dpy-10 mutants have been shown to be more stiff than wild-type animals ( 47 ) and express the innate immune gene nlp-29 at high levels constitutively ( 48 ), while also being more permeable to a Hoescht staining protocol ( 27 ), suggesting a multifaceted role for dpy-10 in protection and permeability. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared bus-8 mutants are significantly shorter (time to burst = 25 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds), as previously observed in literature ( 45 ) ( Fig. 4C and D ; Fig. S4A). Despite a disordered epidermal morphology and disrupted cuticle integrity in bus-8 animals, mCeMbio consistently promotes cuticle integrity (time to burst = 39 seconds) compared to OP50 (time to burst = 25 seconds) ( Fig. 4D ). To normalize across multiple experiments and variable times to burst, we evaluated the fold change in burst time compared to animals raised on OP50. We observed significant differences in the fold change in burst time of bus-8 animals raised on mCeMbio and JUb19 compared to animals raised on OP50, with mCeMbio providing 1.4-fold increases in burst time and JUb19 providing a 1.3-fold increase; JUb101 does not significantly increase the fold change in burst time but shows variability between experiments (Fig. S4B through D). Interestingly, the cuticle-adherent CBX151 caused either parental death or suppressed growth in bus-8 animals, preventing us from testing this condition consistently in this cuticle mutant background. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared dpy-10 mutants are significantly longer (time to burst = 145 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds) ( Fig. 4C and E ). Dpy-10 animals raised on CBX151 (time to burst = 457 seconds), mCeMbio (time to burst = 302 seconds), JUb19 (time to burst = 219 seconds), or JUb101 (time to burst = 291 seconds) display noticeably longer cuticle burst times compared to dpy-10 animals raised on OP50 (time to burst = 145 seconds) ( Fig. 4E ). This relationship is consistent with the fold change over OP50 observed for animals raised on CBX151 (3.9-fold), mCeMbio (2.3-fold), JUb19 (1.9-fold), and JUb101 (2.2-fold) (Fig. S4D). Given the consistency of increased cuticle integrity in both wild-type and cuticle mutants reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50, bacteria–bacteria interactions likely impact C. elegans bleach sensitivity. Moreover, dpy-10 mutants reared on JUb101 or JUb19 promote cuticle protection compared to OP50, unmasking a subtle yet consistent impact of these bacteria on the cuticle. Despite being a single species, CBX151 is also a consistent promoter of cuticle integrity, suggesting a role for adherence to cuticle structures still present on dpy-10 and bus-8 mutants. Interestingly, these cuticle structures may be critical for the adherence of some of the mCeMbio strains. We performed 16S sequencing on these sensitized strains to observe the composition of mCeMbio species present on the surfaces of the C. elegans mutants. We show the composition of serially washed (unbleached) bus-8, dpy-10 , dpy-8 , and srf-3 mutants compared to wild-type controls collected alongside them. We observe that bus-8, dpy-10 , dpy-8 , and srf-3 mutants all display reduced abundance of JUb101, the candidate skin-adherent bacterial species in this study (Fig. S4E and F). Moreover, bus-8, dpy-8 , and srf-3 mutants have increased abundance of JUb19, the putative gut-resident microbe in this study (Fig. S4E and F). These results allow us to begin to associate some cuticle structures with bacterial adherence.",
    "Conclusion": "Bacteria–host interactions are complex and known to impact many aspects of host biology. Consequently, the study of ecologically relevant bacterial communities is often traded for the simplicity of single species. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of ecologically relevant communities of bacteria and uncover a C. elegans skin-resident microbiome. We reared animals on a natural C. elegans microbiota, mCeMbio, and discovered that most of the mCeMbio bacteria can be removed by bleaching protocols, suggesting that these bacteria may reside on the cuticle surface ( Fig. 1A and B ). We observed that our surface-sterilized worm CFU counts match those in previous findings ( 33 ), whereas serially washed, unbleached worms have significantly more bacteria ( Fig. 1B and 3A ). We conjectured that there are abundant skin-resident bacteria, approximating counts from simplified arithmetic of [# unbleached CFU] – [# bleached CFU] – [# supernatant CFU] ( Fig. 1A ). To supplement this finding, we developed and implemented a novel micro-swab to isolate skin microbes from C. elegans cuticles. We measured the growth of swabbed OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria from C. elegans cuticles and observed distinct and repeatable patterns of relative growth between washing conditions ( Fig. 1D through G ); more washes are required to remove mCeMbio bacteria from the cuticle, implying that mCeMbio contains surface-adherent bacteria. We then conducted 16S rRNA gene sequencing to define strain-level microbial differences among serially washed and bleached animals. From these data emerged candidate gut- ( Stenotrophomonas JUb19 and Ochrobactrum MYb71) and skin-dominant bacteria ( Enterobacter JUb101 and Sphingobacterium BIGb0170). Although our two independent sequencing experiments revealed different proportions of microbes (Fig. S2A and C), both experiments suggest that there are distinct communities in animals with intact microbiomes compared to those without surface microbes ( Fig. 2C through J ; Fig. S2B). Importantly, the microbiomes from animals with cuticle-adherent microbes are distinct from those of their bacterial lawns ( Fig. 2G and I ), indicating some level of selection on the surface of the cuticle. Although we cannot confirm whether the composition of the supernatant from washed animals, which is composed of loosely attached bacteria, is similar to or distinct from the environment or animal surface, we focused on the more strongly attached bacteria. We further confirmed the persistence of skin-resident microbes compared to more gut-resident microbes by measuring bacterial growth from skin swabs of animals reared on these species ( Fig. 3D through G ). We hypothesize that multiple species within mCeMbio may also associate with the C. elegans cuticle to varying degrees. None of the mCeMbio bacteria are known to be pathogenic, although the individual isolates demonstrate varying effects on host developmental rates ( 33 ). Given the symbiotic nature of these bacteria and our parallel lines of validation of surface-adherent bacteria, we hypothesized that the mCeMbio community serves a role in cuticle protection against environmental stressors. We conducted a well-established cuticle fragility assay and observed the consistent role of mCeMbio and CBX151, a known cuticle-adherent bacterium, to promote cuticle integrity in the host, which varies across the individual bacterial species in mCeMbio ( Fig. 4A and B ). From these data, we demonstrate the importance of studying community effects and the effects of single bacterial species on cuticle integrity. Put together, we uncover a protective effect for animals reared on a consortium of ecologically relevant bacteria. The data from our study do not differentiate between the combinatorial effects of the mCeMbio bacteria on the skin and in the gut, and the mechanism of this protection requires further examination. Several species of bacteria found in association with C. elegans are known to, directly and indirectly, protect against pathogens in the worm intestine ( 49 ). Other protective benefits may be derived from diverse nutritional or metabolic mechanisms unique to the mCeMbio bacteria ( 33 ). This may provide an indirect mechanism by which gut-dominant bacteria, like MYb71, are able to protect the cuticle. Moreover, both known skin-resident bacteria and members of the mCeMbio consortium have been shown to prime the cuticle against other infections ( 50 ). This protection may even be attributed to the potential hydrogen peroxide-degrading capabilities of the mCeMbio consortium, which have been observed in strains of E. coli ( 51 ). Importantly, we sought to examine skin-enriched microbes and the mCeMbio consortium as a whole, which involves both bacteria–bacteria and host–bacteria interactions. This is highlighted by greater cuticle resistance in animals raised on the mCeMbio community (time to burst = 277 seconds) compared to all but one of the individual mCeMbio members, the gut-enriched strain Ochrobactrum MYb71 ( Fig. 4B ). This suggests that most single host–bacteria interactions may not fully recapitulate the extent of interactions in our system and demonstrates the importance of studying communities of ecologically relevant microbes. In an effort to develop C. elegans as a model for understanding skin and associated diseases, we must make use of sensitized and protective strains. To do this, we used C. elegans mutants with varying levels of disordered cuticle structure and function. We found that mCeMbio, JUb19, JUb101, as well as the known skin-adherent microbe CBX151 increase protection in nearly all sensitized and protective mutants ( Fig. 4C through E ; Fig. S4A through D; Table 2 ). However, we have not confirmed that these mutant animals can be vessels for bacterial growth on their skin, given their disrupted state. We see effects on these sensitized mutants and correlate those effects to the presence of skin microbes. It is also plausible that, similar to our findings in wild-type animals, these effects could be due to nutritional supplementation from mCeMbio bacteria or otherwise mediated through the gut.

Set 1 is shown in Fig. 4C through E . All data are shown in Fig. S4 B through D. b NA, Not available because that group was not tested in that individual experiment. Interestingly, the washed (unbleached) C. elegans with mutations in cuticle genes display 16S profiles different from those of the washed (unbleached) wild-type animals. These differences are most starkly observed in the decreased abundance of putative skin-adherent microbe, JUb101, and increased presence of JUb19 across nearly all of the sensitized cuticle mutant strains. We do not have data for bleached cuticle mutant strains; due to their sensitized nature, the standard bleaching protocol was too harsh for most of the animals. Therefore, we are unable to compare between washed and bleached conditions. However, we observe that mCeMbio is able to rescue the cuticle mutants, which suggests that even small populations of the strains are protective or that the protection comes from aforementioned indirect influences. Given the symbiotic nature of the mCeMbio bacteria, which includes 11/12 published CeMbio strains; unique cuticle structures of the nematode skin such as the annuli, alae, or invagination sites; and community effects on promoting barrier function, our data support the existence of and role for a previously unappreciated C. elegans skin microbiome. Our work supports the continued efforts to make the study of C. elegans more ecologically relevant and suggests that we continue to understand and increase environmental enrichment to improve the relevance of this model system.",
