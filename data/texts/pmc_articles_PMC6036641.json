    "Abstract": "Abstract Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture ( 1 – 5 ). While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT ( 6 – 11 ). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.",
    "Results": "Eight NHPs were removed from the study between the 2 and 4 month time points due to pulmonary complications; NHPs younger than 50 months old at IR were more prone to a level of pulmonary toxicity that met criteria for a humane endpoint than those older than 50 months at irradiation (p = 0.03) as illustrated in Figure 2 . Pulmonary effects will be described in a separate report. Figure 2.

P = 0.03 A linear regression was performed that compared the BMD and C.Th in NHPs that received hexyl vs saline to determine any radioprotective effects on bone changes; hexyl treatment did not affect the measured bone outcomes as measured by comparing slope of the regression ( Figure. 3 ). Body weight increased from baseline during the follow up period ( Figure 4 ). The mean bodyweight prior to IR was 6.9 kg, and 7.12 kg at time of first follow up. For those NHPs enrolled until the study period, the mean body weight at time of last follow up was 8.27 kg. Figure 3. Open in a new tab No protective effect of hexyl on measured bone outcomes. Bone mineral density (Top; BMD) and Cortical Thickness (Bottom; Ct.Th) were plotted using linear regression comparing animals that received hexyl vs saline. Neither test was significant. Figure 4.

Median body mass (kg) (whiskers 5–95%) as a function of time following the baseline whole body CT scan Chest only irradiation occurred at 2 months after the baseline imaging was performed and this was set to time point t = 0. For NHPs that remained to the study conclusion, significant loss of Ct.Th in the in-field T9 occurred by 2 months post-IR (p = 0.0009), and this loss persisted to 8 months ( Figure 5 , Bottom Graphs ). In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae located out-of-field, either L2 or L4. Reduced BMD in these animals was observed by 4 months post-IR for T9 and by 6 months post IR for L2, and L4 (p < 0.01; Figure 6 ). In those NHPs that were removed prior to the study conclusion, both Ct.Th and BMD were lower in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 months post-IR (p < 0.05; Figures 5 and 6 ; Bottom Graphs ). At an even more distant site, the whole pelvis, BMD was not different at the endpoint for those that were removed from the study prior to conclusion (2 months; p>0.4) or in those that remained to study conclusion (8 months; p>0.08). Histologically, the regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased cortical porosity ( Figure 7 ). Figure 5.

    "Conclusion": "As the use of high dose per fraction SBRT becomes more commonplace in modern practice, it is important to understand and quantify the impact of high dose RT on surrounding normal bone both inside and outside the treatment field. During thoracic and lumbar SBRT, bones are commonly exposed to relatively high RT doses ( 2 , 6 ). Standard fractionation regimens for lung tumors range from 10 to 18 Gy per fraction over a 3 to 5 fraction course ( 35 ). In some situations doses up to 34 Gy in a single fraction may be given to lung lesions ( 36 ). This unavoidably exposes nearby healthy bone to high doses of radiation per fraction as well. There are currently limited data concerning the acute consequences of high dose per fraction RT to bone. A majority of the pre-clinical literature available has been focused on the late outcomes involving rodent or cell models with fractions of 2 Gy or less ( 12 – 15 ). The limited clinical studies on this topic have shown that thoracic SBRT is associated with changes in bone structural quality directly impacting bone strength. Okoukoni et al. described significant cortical rib thinning in regions receiving ≥ 10 Gy after SBRT ( 6 ). Other studies have shown an association between thoracic SBRT and a higher incidence of late rib fractures (approaching 40%) ( 7 – 9 , 11 , 37 ). Similarly, vertebral SBRT has been associated with increased progression of VCF ( 38 ). Post-mortem analysis of vertebral bodies exposed to SBRT have demonstrated bone fracture, cortical thinning, necrosis, and fibrosis ( 39 ). Although the animals treated in this study received radiation to their entire thoracic spine, extrapolation from these data could help shape our expectations of the types of bone changes we should anticipate following more localized treatments like SBRT. Such conformal therapies, can expose one to several vertebral bodies to high doses of radiation per fraction on the order of those used here. In this study, we observed rapid cortical thinning and trabecular bone loss after whole chest IR to a dose of 10 Gy in 1 fraction in a clinically applicable nonhuman primate (NHP) model. Post-IR pulmonary toxicity was significantly correlated to the age at time of IR where younger NHPs were more sensitive to effects of IR. Approximately 50% of the NHPs were removed due to complications suggestive of pneumonitis, with an average age of 51 months. The average age of those NHPs that lived to the study conclusion was 83 months. Interestingly, this coincides with the age of skeletal maturity (peak BMD) in male rhesus macaques defined as 84 months by Cerroni et al ( 40 ). Animals that died within 4 months post IR experienced rapid persistent bone loss by 2 months post IR throughout the vertebral spine at T9, L2, and L4 in both the trabecular and cortical compartments. Conversely, in those animals that survived to the end of the study, the cortical bone loss was confined to the radiation field only. In these older NHPs that were closer to skeletal maturity at the time of IR, BMD change was noted by 4 months post IR in T9, and by 6 months in L2, and L4. Body weight increased as a function of time post IR (p=0.005; Figure 4 ). Therefore, the observed changes BMD changes were not related to reduced body weight (which is accepted covariate for BMD) ( 41 ). The younger animals in this cohort may have experienced more significant growth and bone turnover than older animals, and their more rapidly growing cells may have been more sensitive to lower doses of RT as well as more pronounced systemic inflammatory effects. The scatter and leakage dose in the lumbar spine, outside the defined IR fields, for these animals was roughly 0.5 – 3% of the dose at the isocenter, which would correlate with doses of roughly 5 – 30 cGy ( Figure 1 ). Doses on the order of 0.5 Gy to 2 Gy have been shown in vivo and in vitro to stimulate an early increase in the number and function of osteoclasts ( 42 – 45 ). In clinical studies, doses as low as 5 Gy have been associated with rapid local bone loss ( 13 ). This increased sensitivity of bone in the younger NHPs is also highlighted by the lack of changes in BMD at an even more distant site, the whole pelvis, which received no dose ( Figure 1 ). Thus the dose threshold for bone damage is unclear, but possibly very low. Given that these animals reached a humane endpoint due to pneumonitis related toxicity, some of bone changes observed may have also been related to decreased physical activity. On histologic analysis trabeculae were qualitatively noted to be unusually thick and oddly shaped in multiple regions throughout the bone, with increased porosity throughout, but also with focal regions of pronounced cortical thickness. Additionally, there was ossification of cartilage above the growth plate and an apparent lack of bone turnover throughout the samples. Empty lacunae were not observed from the vertebrae. While hexyl was not observed to protect against bone loss, the actions of SOD in bone has been shown to have protective effects on bone osteoprogenitors and osteocytes ( 33 , 34 , 46 ). These histologic findings correlated spatially with thinning identified from quantitative/3D models ( Figure 7 ). The structural bone changes induced by IR are thought to be the result of multiple physiologic processes affecting osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone vascularity ( 15 , 47 ). Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that RT directly damages osteoblasts and their precursors leading to impaired matrix production and lower BMD ( 14 , 16 , 48 ). Early up regulation of osteoclast activity leading to rapid bone loss post RT has been reported in rodent models ( 15 , 44 , 49 ). Radiation has been shown to cause an early and substantial increase the expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes, including Rankl, Mcp1, and TNF-α ( 44 ). Young mice irradiated with an acute, large doses comparable to the chest dose in this study (7.25 and 8.0 Gy) exhibited rapid loss of bone ( 50 , 51 ) coincident with increased systemic biomarkers of TRAP5b ( 51 ), a circulating biomarker for osteoclast activity. Additionally, prophylactic use of osteoclast inhibitors have been shown to decrease acute RT induced bone loss in rodents ( 15 ). Moreover, exposure of young mice to high dose radiation of 7.25 Gy has been shown to reduce circulating biomarkers of bone formation and osteoblast activity, including sclerostin and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide ( 50 ). Therefore it is likely that the rapid bone loss seen here is facilitated by at least a contribution from both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, though rapid bone loss is likely a feature of elevated osteoclast activity. This study presents several limitations. As noted, the primary study was examining the protective effects of Hexyl on pulmonary toxicity. In this study, hexyl did not have a protective effect on bone morphology. The cohort of NHPs chosen were based on available samples at the intitation of the study, thus age and weight matching was not possible, however this enabled us to detect that younger NHPs are more radiation sensitive in terms of both bone loss and reaching endpoints associated with pneunonitis. Unfortunately, the sample preparation for the histology permitted H&E staining, but attempts at histochemical staining for osteoclast (TRAP) or osteoblast (ALP) number and activity failed. Thus we are limited to presenting gross observational data.",
