    "Abstract": "Abstract A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.

    "Results": "We tested commercial FEP tissue culture bags for the ability to support microalgae growth without agitation or active mixing of gases with liquids. Under daylight fluorescent lighting, the bags are able to support robust growth for both cw15 and WT strains ( Figures 1A–D ). Time courses of growth show a 1 day delay in the bags ( Figures 1E–H ). Logistic growth curve regressions of optical density estimated the maximum doubling time for cw15 was 5.32 h in flasks and 8.01 h in FEP bags ( Figure 1E ). For WT, maximal doubling time was 7.42 h for flasks and 8.98 h for FEP bags ( Figure 1F ). Similar doubling times were estimated from cell counts: 5.7 versus 7.65 h for cw15 and 7.3 versus 8.73 h for WT ( Figures 1G,H ). Cell counts estimated a 600- to 1450-fold increase in cell number during the culture indicating 9–11 cell doublings in the batch cultures. Dry weight biomass was in rank order with the measurements of optical density and cell density at the 6 days time point. The cw15 flask cultures had the lowest biomass at 0.61 g/L, and the WT flask cultures had the highest biomass at 0.95 g/L ( Figure 1I ). The FEP tissue culture bags grew to a cell density in-between flask cultures for cw15 and WT. These data indicate the bags provide sufficient gas exchange to support microalgae, but that Chlamydomonas laboratory strains grow faster in flasks. FIGURE 1.

Trend lines are logistic growth curve regressions. (I) Average biomass produced after 6 days of culture. (J) Dose-response of WT algae to UVC light. Trend line is an exponential regression. Error bars in all panels are standard deviation. To identify genes required for growth in tissue culture bags, we mutagenized the strains prior to competitive growth assays. We first determined the dose-response for cell lethality in a UVC light chamber. Figure 1J shows that 6–10 mJ of UVC exposure is sufficient to kill ∼90% of WT cells. Similar results were obtained for cw15 , and we concluded that 8 mJ of UVC would give sufficient DNA damage to induce mutations in both strains without risking excessive cell death and culture failure during spaceflight. An EVT was completed at the Kennedy Space Center ( Figure 2 ). Three biological replicates of WT and cw15 were mutagenized at the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States. The mutagenized cells were transferred to tissue culture bags with TAP media and stored at room temperature in the dark for 7 days to emulate a late load and storage during a resupply mission to the ISS. The cultures were then transferred to a Veggie unit to provide light and stimulate photosynthesis. The culture bags were placed under bungee cords that hold plant pillows in the Veggie reservoir ( Figure 2B ). The bags were left without any agitation except during passages ( Figure 2C ). To complete a passage, culture bags were removed from the reservoir, agitated manually, and 1 mL of culture was transferred to fresh media for a new growth cycle ( Figures 2D–F ). An additional 2 mL of culture was sampled and cell pellets were frozen to preserve a DNA sample without dark storage. FIGURE 2.

(E,F) Passage of culture using sterile syringes. The remaining culture was stored in a closed CTB to simulate ambient storage on the ISS and return of live cultures to Earth ( Figure 3A ). At 36 days after the initial inoculation, all culture bags were sampled for DNA extraction and biomass assessment ( Figure 3B ). The WT strain showed higher biomass compared to the cw15 cell wall mutant ( p = 0.01, paired Student’s t -test). Within each strain, there was a significant trend for increased biomass with additional culture passages ( p < 0.01, ANOVA). However, all biomass levels were lower than immediate harvest of cells after 6 days of culture without UV mutagenesis or dark storage ( Figure 1I ). The biomass trends observed most likely reflect loss of biomass due to respiration during dark storage. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab (A) Storage of live algae cultures in CTB soft stowage bag. (B) Biomass yield after dark storage. Average and standard deviation of three biological replicates are plotted. Lowercase letters indicate statistically significant groups of culture passages based on ANOVA of each strain and a Tukey HSD test. Whole genome sequencing of the pre-mutagenized cultures, frozen cell pellets, and dark stored cultures was completed with an average read depth of 16x. Variants consisting of SNPs and short InDel polymorphisms were called with CRISP using pooled sample parameters ( Figure 4 ). After removing missing data (≥30%) and monomorphic polymorphisms (MAF = 0), we detected 73,573 WT variants and 79,455 cw15 variants. Filtering to remove low-depth and low-quality reads reduced WT and cw15 polymorphic variants to 48,380 and 53,939, respectively. This represents an average of one variant per 2.24 kbp in WT and 2.01 kbp in cw15 . FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Sequence analysis pipeline with key parameters for variant calling and quality filtering. Plotting the variant density across the genome identified known hotspots of natural variation among laboratory strains ( Figure 5 , Gallaher et al., 2015 ). The WT strain is a sequence-verified clone of CC-1690, and the polymorphic variants identified overlapping peaks on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9. In addition, there were peaks that overlapped with other natural variants on chromosomes 3 and 12. The cw15 strain derives from a cross with CC-1690 and a similar pattern of natural variant peaks was observed. These natural variants may represent spontaneous mutations that are easily tolerated in Chlamydomonas or regions of the genome that are difficult to align with high confidence. In either case, known natural variants are likely to have little signal of selection due to induced UVC mutagenesis. We removed all exact matches to natural variants to obtain 5286 WT and 5873 cw15 novel variants, which are more evenly distributed across the genome ( Figure 5 ). The average genomic density for the novel variants were one variant per 20.83 kbp in WT and 18.75 kbp in cw15 . FIGURE 5.

The variant dataset plotted is labeled on the right of each panel. Variants from 39 laboratory strains (black, top panel) and CC-1690 (black, second panel) sequenced by Gallaher et al. (2015) . Light and dark gray show all high quality variants (step 4 in Figure 4 ) in the WT and cw15 strains. Orange (WT) and green ( cw15 ) plot novel variants after filtering identical matches to polymorphisms in the Gallaher et al. (2015) study (step 5 in Figure 4 ). The novel variants show a different spectrum of base changes than natural variants ( Figure 6A ). There is a relative decrease in transitions and an increase in transversions with the complementary mutations of A > C and T > G as well as C > G and G > C predominating. These data suggest the novel variants represent mutations caused by induced mutagenesis instead of the endogenous spectrum of Chlamydomonas variants. In addition, the novel mutations are found at a higher allele frequency indicating that the novel mutations have more sequence read support across samples than natural variants ( Figure 6B ). We conclude that novel variants better represent the UVC mutagenized sites. FIGURE 6. Open in a new tab Effects of variant filtering and live culture storage on mutations detected.

(B) Minor allele frequency distribution for all variants and novel variants. (C,D) Average sequencing depth of three biological replicate libraries prepared from dark stored cultures and algae pellets that were frozen at the time of passage. (E,F) Average number of novel mutations detected in libraries from dark stored and frozen tissues. Error bars are standard deviations. Centrifugation and freezing cell pellets for DNA sampling requires more extensive astronaut time and limiting resources on the ISS. We compared the mutations recovered from samples that had been frozen at the time of passage and those from live cultures that had been stored in the dark. There were no significant differences in sequencing depth based on the storage conditions ( Figures 6C,D ). However, dark storage decreased the number of mutations recovered in passage 1, which were cultures stored for 22 days prior to sampling ( Figures 6E,F ). Student’s t -tests showed a significant reduction of mutations detected for the WT strain ( p = 0.003), but the reduction was non-significant for cw15 ( p = 0.07). For frozen stored libraries, the number of novel mutations detected in each passage was nearly constant indicating sequencing depth was limiting for mutant detection. These results suggest that changes in allele frequency over culture passages are not a reliable indicator of selection for this experiment. To assess the effects of novel mutation on protein coding sequences, SnpEff was used to identify protein coding changes. Natural variants were enriched for synonymous mutations, while the novel variants were enriched for protein coding changes ( Figure 7A ). These results are consistent with an increased frequency of deleterious mutations after UV mutagenesis. Individual genes were tested for selection based on nucleotide diversity (π) using SNPGenie. Novel variants were enriched for genes showing evidence of positive selection with about 46% of genes tested having π N > π S , compared to 29% of all variants ( Figure 7B ). These results are consistent with the enrichment for non-synonymous mutations resulting from UV mutagenesis. FIGURE 7. Open in a new tab Novel variants are enriched for predicted protein coding changes. (A) Ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous variants based on SnpEff annotations. White and gray show natural variants detected. Orange and green show novel variants. (B) Average fraction of genes showing positive selection of all genes tested with SNPGenie. Averages are from six libraries per passage. Error bars are standard deviations. (C) Enriched GO terms for genes with positive selection. Based on GO term enrichment analyses, the positively selected genes in WT and cw15 both show significant enrichments for terms associated with purine nucleotide binding and hydrolase activity ( Figure 7C ). The individual genes with these GO terms represent information processing functions in DNA damage repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, and signal transduction ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The WT libraries also had enrichment for terms associated with small molecule transporters with individual genes predominantly being ABC transporters. The WT strain also had significant enrichments for genes under purifying selection ( Figure 8 ). More than half of these genes are predicted to function in regulating the levels of cyclic nucleotide second messengers suggesting that second messenger signal transduction may be under selective pressure in in the culture bag growth system. The cw15 strain had no significantly-enriched GO terms for genes under purifying selection. FIGURE 8.

    "Conclusion": "This EVT validated a strategy for identifying genes required by Chlamydomonas during log phase growth in spaceflight. We have shown that commercial FEP tissue culture bags can be used for batch culture of microalgae and result in 9–11 cell doublings during a 6 day culture. Cells in these cultures that divide normally will be at least 1000 fold enriched at stationary phase over cells with genetic variants that prevent mitotic division. Competition through multiple passages will eliminate mutations that prevent mitotic growth. Chlamydomonas is viable in these bags after prolonged dark storage, which enables full genome sequencing and identification of mutant genes in the culture. We have since used this strategy to grow the WT and cw15 strains during the SpaceX CRS-15 mission; analysis of the spaceflight experiment is on-going. Whole genome sequencing has been used to assess the mutagenic load of the bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus , in a 2 week spaceflight exposure ( Guo et al., 2015 ). Less than 40 SNPs were detected in the genome from spaceflight with similar numbers of SNPs detected on ground and in spaceflight. These data suggest that exogenous mutagenesis is necessary to gain adequate signal of selection in short-term competitive growth experiments. A yeast selection experiment was completed in spaceflight by using a genome-wide deletion collection ( Nislow et al., 2015 ). The competitive growth experiment measured the reduction in representation of bar-coded mutants over the course of ∼21 mitotic generations. This type of competitive growth identifies individual genes needed for growth. By contrast, UVC mutagenesis has a higher genetic load and generates a more diverse array of allele types to compete within the culture. Moreover, three serial batch cultures of Chlamydomonas are expected to give ∼30 mitotic generations potentially giving more signal of selection within the genome sequence data. There are several limitations to the design of this competitive growth assay. The algae were grown in mixotrophic conditions with both acetate and light as sources of energy. The addition of acetate to the media promotes rapid growth of the cultures allowing up to four passages to be completed in a 1-month SpaceX commercial resupply mission. Consequently, genes under purifying selection are expected to include pathways to utilize acetate. Similarly, the Veggie growth chamber has a limited spectrum of lighting with three narrow wavelengths that do not include far-red light ( Massa et al., 2016 ). Each wavelength has two to four light level settings, and the lighting needed to be enriched for red light to provide 80–100 μmol/m 2 /s of light to the culture bags. Limitations to random mutagenesis are that loss-of-function mutations in all genes are not represented in each biological replicate of the experiment and that multiple mutations are simultaneously selected in individual cells during mitotic divisions. Moreover, we found that all cultures had a high level of polymorphisms that were identical to previously described natural variants in laboratory strains ( Gallaher et al., 2015 ). The sequencing depth and 30 mitotic generations of the experiment did not provide sufficient sensitivity to detect changes in allele frequencies of individual natural variants. Consequently, we focused on selection signatures in novel mutations that were unique to UV mutagenized cultures. Ultraviolet light causes direct DNA damage to create cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and the UV mutation signature is typically biased toward C > T transitions ( Ikehata and Ono, 2011 ). Chlamydomonas DNA readily forms pyrimidine dimers, and WT strains have a robust dark-repair pathway to repair 90–95% of the DNA damage directly within 24 h ( Small, 1987 ). With whole genome sequencing, we observed enrichment for T > G and C > G transversions in the mutations resulting from the UV treatment instead of the expected C > T transitions. Incorporation of several oxidative products of guanine can promote C > G transversions in response to a variety of mutagens, including UV ( Kino and Sugiyama, 2005 ). In human cancers, C > G base changes are associated with activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases followed by error-prone translesion synthesis ( Forbes et al., 2017 ). Human cancers also have base substitution signatures that are enriched for T > G, such as COSMIC signatures 17b and 28 ( Forbes et al., 2017 ). However, no specific mechanisms have been proposed for the specific enrichment of T > G transversions. Intriguingly, we observed signatures of selection in DNA polymerase ζ, θ, and REV1 ( Supplementary Table S1 ), which are associated with translesion synthesis ( Sakamoto, 2019 ). In the human germ line, C > G mutations have been suggested to be caused by errors in double-stand break repair ( Gao et al., 2019 ). DNA polymerase θ and DNA ligase 4 function in the non-homologous end joining double strand break repair pathway, and we found evidence of selection for both of these enzymes in the EVT ( Pannunzio et al., 2018 ). Evidence for selection in double-strand break repair and translesion synthesis suggests that these pathways are likely relevant to the UV-induced mutations observed. The low sequence coverage of this experiment creates risk in using the frequency of recovery for specific mutant alleles in determining whether specific genes are under positive or purifying selection. The number of alleles discovered is limited by the sequencing depth, and higher coverage is necessary to increase the power of the statistics to detect selection at a genome-wide level. Nevertheless, we were able to classify 476 genes in the WT strain and 503 genes in the cw15 strain for purifying or positive selection based on mutations within coding sequences. Among these, 104 genes were enriched for molecular functions based on GO terms. In addition to DNA repair pathways, these analyses revealed signal transduction and other information processing functions including, chromatin reading, RNA processing, and translation to be enriched within selected genes. The enriched molecular functions are predicted to be processes necessary for Chlamydomonas to adapt to the UV mutagenesis, lack of media agitation, the diffusion of gases across the FEP membrane, and the lighting conditions in the Veggie unit. Scalable production of Chlamydomonas in spaceflight has multiple potential applications. The species will accumulate lipids to about 20–25% of total biomass, which can be used as an organic chemical feedstock ( Becker, 2007 ; Xu et al., 2018 ). Chlamydomonas also has high protein content of 40–60% of biomass making it a potential source of food. Although it is not yet designated as a GRAS organism by the FDA, Chlamydomonas is non-toxic; animal feeding studies show no harmful effects at 4 g algae biomass per kg body weight per day, the highest consumption levels tested ( Murbach et al., 2018 ). Equivalent consumption for a 65 kg person would be approximately 260 g of algae powder per day. As a genetic model organism, Chlamydomonas biomass composition can be further modified by mutagenesis or targeted gene editing. For example, starch over-accumulation mutants have been isolated that shift starch content from 15 to 30–35% of biomass ( Koo et al., 2017 ). Likewise, CRISPR gene editing of the Chlamydomonas zeaxanthin epoxidase gene significantly increases carotenoids needed to prevent macular degeneration ( Baek et al., 2018 ). The modified algae strain was used to supplement chicken feed to increase the zeaxanthin content of eggs. The myriad of potential applications for microalgae production in spaceflight justify direct investigation of the genes needed for liquid culture production. Our current study shows both feasibility for a spaceflight experiment and identifies a series of cellular information processing genes that are likely required for Chlamydomonas to adapt to batch culture in breathable plastic bags.",
