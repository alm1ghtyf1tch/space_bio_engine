    "Abstract": "Abstract Control of biofilms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective against them and to isolate resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes involved in enhanced biofilm resistance. While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (“flow biofilms”). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms.",
    "Results": "BioFlux device. High-throughput screening of flow biofilm viability requires a device that permits development of multiple biofilms with controlled flow rates and determination of viability in real time. We constructed such a device (Fig. 1 A) with microfluidic channels integrated into microtiter well plates. The use of a standard well plate format (Fig. 1B ) allowed compatibility with plate readers and multichannel pipettors, and the plate also could be examined microscopically. The microfluidic channels are generated using photolithography-etched micropatterned silicon wafers as a mold for polydimethylsiloxane, which forms the sides and roofs of the channels. The bottom of the channels consists of standard 180-μm coverslip glass, which allows microscopic examination. The channels connect pairs of microtiter wells; one well of each pair is the inlet well from which fresh medium is pushed by pneumatic pressure through the channel into the outlet well, which holds the spent medium (Fig. 1C ). The microfluidic channels are 1/10 the size of conventional flow cells, which permits laminar flow at a wider range of flow rates and results in uniform biofilm growth in the entire channel. Figure 2 shows P. fluorescens biofilm formation, which appeared to be qualitatively similar to PAO1 biofilm formation; the series of images was taken 0.5 to 21 h after flow was initiated. FIG. 2. Open in a new tab Biofilm formation and development in a BioFlux channel. The images are phase-contrast images obtained after flow began (the flow was from left to right; each channel was 370 μm wide) and show initial attachment (0.5 and 1 h), microcolony formation (2 and 3 h), and development (4, 5, and 6.5 h) into fully formed biofilms (21 h). The system includes an air compressor and electropneumatic regulators to deliver precisely controlled pressure to each channel via a manifold that interfaces with individual wells of the microtiter plate. Thus, the flow (and shear) rate in each channel can be controlled individually. A thin transparent heating stage provides temperature control, and a software interface permits control of the flow rate by the user and saving and reuse of experimental profiles. Unlike conventional flow cell systems, the BioFlux plates are presterilized and do not require assembly or tubing connections, which minimizes the possibility of contamination. The plates each contain 24 channels connecting 48 wells (Fig. 1B ). The BioFlux system controls four plates simultaneously, providing a total of 96 biofilms. Each inlet well and outlet well holds 1.25 ml of liquid, so there can be 11 to 20 h of continuous flow before replenishment is necessary at commonly used flow rates. The small volume of the microchannels also results in conservation of reagents. Quantification of viability by measurement of fluorescence. Flow cell biofilm viability is generally determined using the LIVE/DEAD Bac Light stain combined with imaging of green fluorescence and red fluorescence, which indicate live and dead cells, respectively. However, according to recent reports, this method can overestimate the number of viable cells remaining after treatment with low levels of antimicrobial agents, evidently due to changes in membrane permeability that facilitate disproportionate uptake of SYTO9 green (the green “viable” dye) ( 3 , 24 ). An alternate method to measure viability by fluorescence is to use green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria and the red fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) ( 24 ). To test if this method provides a reliable measure of biofilm viability, we first experimented with static biofilms. These biofilms can be removed, which permits plate counting, and thus are suitable for comparison to a standard method. Biofilms were grown in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h, treated with bleach at different concentrations (in quadruplicate), and either stained with PI or removed for colony counting (Fig. 3 ). Emission spectra were collected for stained biofilms (Fig. 3A and 3B ). The ratio of green fluorescence to red fluorescence was used to estimate biofilm viability, and the results were compared to the viability of identically treated biofilms determined by plate counting. The two methods showed that there were comparable dose-dependent responses to bleach treatment for UPEC (Fig. 3C ) and PAO1 (Fig. 3D ) biofilms. To quantify the correlation between methods, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) and its associated P value for viability estimates obtained in three independent experiments and found that r was 0.9876 and P was 0.0017 for UPEC and that r was 0.9855 and P was 0.0021 for PAO1. The high correlation coefficients and low P values, together with the results of linear regression analyses (Fig. 3E and 3F ), revealed that there was a strong correlation between the methods, validating the GFP-PI method for measuring the viability of two common bacterial biofilm pathogens. FIG. 3. Open in a new tab Comparison of static biofilm viabilities determined by colony counting and by using GFP-PI fluorescence ratios. (A and B) Representative fluorescence emission spectra of quadruplicate GFP-expressing UPEC (A) and PAO1 (B) biofilms following 1 h of treatment with bleach (in saline) at the concentrations indicated (as percentages) and PI staining. The absorption peaks on the left and right correspond to live and dead cells, respectively. (C and D) Mean levels of viability as determined by colony counting and GFP-PI fluorescence (GFP-PI Fluor.) for UPEC (C) and PAO1 (D) biofilms. The error bars indicate standard deviations. (E and F) Linear regression analysis of viability data for the two methods using pooled data from three independent experiments. To determine if the BioFlux device can be used to screen the effects of antimicrobial agents on flow biofilms, we cultivated GFP-expressing PAO1 biofilms in this device. The biofilms were treated with bleach or antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, or enrofloxacin) and then stained with PI, which was followed by measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader. Both the bleach and the antibiotics caused dose-dependent biofilm killing, as determined by fluorescence measured with the plate reader (Fig. 4 ). Bleach was less effective for flow biofilms than it was for static biofilms (86% viability versus 50% viability for 0.05% bleach, 56% viability versus 17% viability for 0.02% bleach, and 6% viability versus 0% viability for 0.2% bleach), and 70% isopropanol was required to completely kill the biofilms. Whether this was due to greater resistance is unclear because in addition to the presence of flow, there are other differences between biofilms grown in 96-well plates and BioFlux biofilms. The quinolones had the most potent effect; ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin caused complete loss of viability at concentrations of 1 and 10 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4D and 4E ). As a further check of the reliability of rapid plate reader scanning for determination of viability, we analyzed biofilm images obtained by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4 , insets), as reported previously ( 25 , 26 ). The biofilm viability calculated from fluorescence ratios obtained using microscope images agreed with that measured with the plate reader (Fig. 4 ); the correlation coefficient ( r = 0.9565; P < 0.0001) and linear regression analysis (Fig. 4F ) verified that there was a strong correlation between the results of the two methods. The fluorescent microscope images confirmed that the quinolones completely eradicated the biofilms (ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and enrofloxacin at a concentration of 10 μg/ml), as indicated by the complete absence of fluorescence (Fig. 4D and 4E , insets). FIG. 4. Open in a new tab Estimates of the viability of GFP-producing P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms cultivated in the BioFlux device following treatment with bleach (A) or various antibiotics (B to E) and then stained with PI. Levels of viability were calculated by using the green fluorescence/red fluorescence ratios determined from quantified microscope images (black bars) and by using plate reader measurements (white bars). Isopropyl alcohol (70%) was used to ensure complete loss of viability. Insets show representative microscope images, including images of untreated (0) and isopropyl-alcohol treated (isop.) controls. Note that no biofilm remained after treatment with the highest dose of enrofloxacin (E) and the two highest doses of ciprofloxacin (D). Fluorescence signals were not detected (N.D.) with the plate reader, and no biofilms were observed using microscopy (insets). (F) Linear regression analysis for determinations of viability by the two methods. We used the GFP-PI method because Lehtinen et al. ( 24 ) showed that it was superior to the Bac Light method for measuring the effects of low concentrations of antimicrobial agents on the viability of planktonic bacteria. The limitation of the Bac Light method at low concentrations of antimicrobials is apparently due to increased penetration of SYTO9 but not PI, which falsely increases the green fluorescence/red fluorescence ratio used to determine viability ( 3 , 24 ). We assumed that this limitation was applicable to bacterial biofilms. The success of the BioFlux device for HTP screening of flow biofilm viability, as reported above, enabled us to test this assumption directly. We cultivated PAO1 biofilms not expressing GFP in the BioFlux apparatus, treated them with gentamicin, stained them with the two Bac Light stains (SYTO9 and PI), and used the ratio of green fluorescence to red fluorescence to calculate the viability. Compared to the GFP-PI fluorescence results, treatment with SYTO9 resulted in much higher levels of green fluorescence for the two low concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml), resulting in a false increase in viability (e.g., viability greater than 100% compared to untreated controls). However, at higher concentrations of the antibiotic the two methods gave comparable results (Fig. 5 ). Similar results were obtained with tobramycin, enrofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin; for example, with 0.01 μg/ml of each antibiotic, the levels of viability determined by the Bac Light light method were 166%, 117%, and 70% of the untreated control values, respectively, while the levels of viability determined by the GFP-PI method were 77%, 44%, and 47% of the untreated control values, respectively (Fig. 4 ). Thus, the Bac Light method gives an erroneous picture of viability after exposure to low antimicrobial agent concentrations not only for planktonic cells but also for biofilms.",
    "Conclusion": "Flow biofilms are commonly cultivated in flow cells, and their viability is determined by quantification of microscopic fluorescent images or by colony counting, both of which are time-consuming; colony counting is particularly difficult because flow biofilms cannot be easily removed from the flow cells. HTP screening of viability by this method is not feasible not only because of these constraints but also because it would require the use of a prohibitively large number of flow cells. We used a microfluidic device, the BioFlux device, which accurately controls fluid flow and permits simultaneous growth of multiple biofilms with a large range of precisely controlled flow rates. Here we describe a method for rapidly determining biofilm viability simply by measuring fluorescence with a plate reader, eliminating the need for the labor-intensive analyses mentioned above. The results show that measurement of GFP-PI fluorescence with a plate reader reliably reflects biofilm viability as verified by plate counting (Fig. 3 ), as well as viability determined by quantification of fluorescence microscope images (Fig. 4 ). Thus, the BioFlux device used in conjunction with the GFP-PI viability assessment method is an excellent method for initial HTP screening of flow biofilms; this was verified by successful use of this method for HTP screening of PAO1 biofilms for sensitivity to a number of antimicrobials. The plate reader-based BioFlux viability screening method relied on the use of bacterial strains expressing GFP; for non-GFP-expressing bacteria another method, such as LIVE/DEAD Bac Light staining, must be used. However, the Bac Light viability method, as reported previously for planktonic cells ( 3 , 24 ) and confirmed here for biofilms, is limited to treatments causing a relatively higher level of killing. This finding appears to limit use of the BioFlux to bacteria capable of expressing GFP. However, there are other possibilities. For example, the LIVE/DEAD stain is accurate for determination of viability where the level of killing is high, which is often the goal of HTP screening; another possibility is to use a fluorogenic substrate, such as 4-methylumbellyferyl-β- d -glucuronide ( 28 ), to measure biofilm metabolic activity. The BioFlux device is also likely to be useful in HTP screening of other biofilm parameters. One example is investigating expression of a fluorescently tagged protein under different conditions, such as fluid shear. Another example is determination of the formation or elimination of the extracellular matrix, which can be done by using poly- N -acetylglucosamine-binding wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate ( 5 ).",
