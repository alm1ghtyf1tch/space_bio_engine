    "Abstract": "Abstract Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic hypotension. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mesenteric arteries and veins will exhibit diminished vasoconstrictor responses after spaceflight. Mesenteric arteries and veins from female mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131 ( n =11), STS-133 ( n =6), and STS-135 ( n =3) shuttle missions and respective ground-based control mice ( n =30) were isolated for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures (2–12 cmH 2 O). Vasoconstriction to NE was also determined in mesenteric arteries at 1, 5, and 7 d postlanding. In arteries, maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine were reduced immediately following spaceflight and 1 d postflight. Spaceflight also reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels. In mesenteric veins, there was diminished constriction to NE after flight. The results indicate that the impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca 2+ release mechanism. Such vascular changes in astronauts could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during orthostatic stress.—Behnke, B. J., Stabley, J. N., McCullough, D. J., Davis, R. T., III, Dominguez, J.

    "Results": "Body and soleus muscle mass For STS-131 mice, total body mass was not different between GC and SF mice (22.0±0.4 vs. 20.9±0.7 g, respectively). Total body mass of STS-133 GC mice (21.7±0.2 g) was greater than that of SF R +1 (18.7±0.3 g) and SF R +5 (20.3±0.1 g) mice, but not different from that of SF R +7 (20.6±0.7 g) mice. And total body mass of STS-135 mice was not different between groups (GC: 19.7±0.5 g; SF: 19.4±1.4 g). Right soleus muscle mass was greater in GC than SF mice in both the STS-131 (GC: 13.5±0.6 mg; SF: 10.4±0.4 mg) and STS-135 (GC: 6.0±0.3 mg; SF: 4.6±0.1 mg) missions; soleus muscle mass was not obtained from STS-133 animals. Vessel characteristics For mesenteric arteries pressurized at 108 cmH 2 O, maximal diameter, medial wall thickness, and spontaneous tone were not different between GC and SF groups on either the STS-131 or STS-133 missions ( Table 1 ). For mesenteric veins pressurized at 4 cmH 2 O, medial wall thickness and spontaneous tone were not different between GC and SF mice from the STS-135 mission ( Table 1 ). However, maximal diameter of mesenteric veins tended to be larger ( P =0.078) in the SF mice ( Table 1 ). Table 1.

GC. Mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responses NE produced a dose-dependent increase in vasoconstriction of mesenteric arteries from both GC and SF animals ( Fig. 1 A ). The vasoconstriction induced by NE was lower in the arteries from SF vs. GC ( Fig. 1 A ). When quantifying temporal vasoconstrictor responses of mesenteric arteries to 10 −4 M NE, both groups demonstrated a delay followed by a monoexponential decrease in lumen diameter. The monoexponential model provided a superb fit, as demonstrated by a high correlation coefficient (GC: r =0.983±0.006; SF: r =0.946±0.042). The speed of vasoconstriction was markedly slower in the SF group, resulting in a doubling in the time taken to reach a steady-state diameter after exposure to NE (GC: 10.0±2.5 s; SF: 20.6±5.6 s; P < 0.05). Arteries from the SF mice demonstrated a prolonged MRT ( i.e ., time delay + time constant; Fig. 1 B ) as well as an ∼50% reduction in the rate of vasoconstriction (Δ vasoconstriction ÷ time constant; Fig. 1 B ) vs. the GC response.

Increases in KCl concentration produced dose-dependent decrease in luminal diameter of mesenteric arteries from both groups; however, constriction evoked by KCl was lower in arteries from SF mice ( Fig. 2 A ). Spaceflight did not alter active myogenic responses to pressure changes ( Fig. 2 B ) or affect the passive-pressure response characteristics of mesenteric arteries ( Fig. 2 B ). Vasoconstrictor responses to caffeine were lower in mesenteric arteries from SF vs. GC mice ( Fig. 3 A ). Figure 2.

There was a tendency ( P =0.064) for RyR-2 mRNA levels to be lower in mesenteric arteries after spaceflight ( Fig. 3 B ), whereas the lower expression of RyR-3 mRNA was significant in the SF vs. GC arteries ( Fig. 3 C ). Time course of adrenergic vasoconstriction during ground recovery from spaceflight Mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responses to NE in GC mice were similar at the R +1, R +5, and R +7, time points, so the data were pooled to provide greater statistical power for determining potential differences between GC and SF vascular responses. NE-evoked constriction was significantly lower in the SF R +1 group relative to that from GC mice ( Fig. 4 A ), and qualitatively similar to results obtained immediately after spaceflight ( Fig. 1 A ). However, after 5 d ( Fig. 4 B ) and 7 d ( Fig. 4 C ) of ground recovery, mesenteric artery vasoconstriction was not different between groups. Figure 4.

Mesenteric vein constrictor responses There was a dose-dependent constriction of mesenteric veins in both SF and GC groups. Venoconstriction to NE was lower in veins from SF mice ( Fig. 5 A ). Mesenteric vein luminal diameter increased as a function of increasing intraluminal pressure in the presence of 10 −4 M NE in both groups. However, intraluminal diameter was greater at each pressure in veins from the SF group ( Fig. 5 B ). Figure 5.

    "Conclusion": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric arteries and veins, and to examine whether putative reductions in vasoconstrictor responsiveness persist up to 1 wk after landing. Based on hindlimb unloading (HU) rodent models, which are ground-based studies to simulate a weightless environment ( 12 , 13 ), we hypothesized that mesenteric vessel responses to NE, KCl, and caffeine would be impaired in SF mice. The results demonstrate that spaceflight diminishes the magnitude ( Fig. 1 A ) and rapidity ( Fig. 1 B ) of mesenteric artery vasoconstriction to the adrenergic agonist NE; microgravity diminishes vasoconstriction to KCl ( Fig. 2 A ) and caffeine ( Fig. 3 A ); and spaceflight does not affect myogenic vasoconstriction ( Fig. 2 B ). The blunted constriction to caffeine, which is mediated through a sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -release mechanism, was associated with lower arterial RyR-2 ( Fig. 2 B ) and RyR-3 ( Fig. 2 C ) mRNA expression. These microgravity-induced changes in arterial vasoconstriction occurred in the absence of any gross structural changes in mesenteric artery wall thickness or maximal interluminal diameter ( Table 1 ), or by any alterations in the passive mechanical properties of the vessels, as indicated by an unaltered passive pressure-diameter response ( Fig. 2 B ). The diminished adrenergic mesenteric artery vasoconstriction persisted 1 d postspaceflight ( Fig. 4 A ), but was similar to that in GC mice at 5 and 7 d postflight ( Fig. 4 B , C ). Finally, spaceflight blunted NE-evoked constriction of mesenteric veins ( Fig. 5 ). These results suggest that on return to Earth, decrements in mesenteric arterial and venous constriction in astronauts could compromise the cardiovascular response to maintain arterial pressure during orthostatic stress. Mechanistic basis for diminished arterial vasoconstriction Following spaceflight, astronauts demonstrate a diminished ability to elevate PVR during orthostasis ( 3 , 6 , 8 ). This reduced PVR occurs despite elevations in sympathetic neural outflow ( 28 ) and higher levels of circulating plasma NE ( 29 ) during microgravity. Such observations support the contention that microgravity induces a hyporesponsiveness of resistance arteries to adrenergic stimuli. Results from the present study confirm that microgravity impairs both the magnitude and rate of mesenteric artery vasoconstriction to NE ( Fig. 1 A , B , respectively). In one of only two studies to previously examine the effects of spaceflight on intrinsic vasomotor responsiveness, Hatton et al. ( 30 ) reported that microgravity blunted NE-mediated vasoconstriction of mesenteric arteries from SF rats. However, because these animals were spontaneously hypertensive, the effects of spaceflight on vascular responses in normotensive animals was uncertain. In the second study, NE-mediated constriction of gastrocnemius feed arteries was found to be lower in SF mice ( 31 ). Collectively, experimental results with rats and mice confirm the contention that spaceflight compromises the vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the peripheral resistance vasculature to adrenergic stimulation. To elucidate potential mechanisms of reduced vasoconstriction after spaceflight, vasoconstrictor responses that occur through discrete mechanisms were determined. NE and KCl cause vasoconstriction through both the influx of extracellular Ca 2+ and intracellular Ca 2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( 32 – 34 ). In contrast, myogenic vasoconstriction appears to be more dependent on extracellular Ca 2+ for smooth muscle contraction ( 35 – 38 ). Several studies have shown that while mobilization of intracellular Ca 2+ stores may occur during myogenic vasoconstriction ( 39 ), release of intracellular Ca 2+ is not an essential component for this vasoconstriction to occur ( 37 , 38 ). Therefore, the differential effects of spaceflight to impair vasoconstriction elicited through both NE ( Fig. 1 A ) and KCl ( Fig. 2 A ), but not via a myogenic response ( Fig. 2 B ), could reflect a deficit in intracellular Ca 2+ release. To test this possibility, caffeine-induced vasoconstriction, which occurs through an intracellular Ca 2+ -release mechanism ( 32 – 34 ), was measured. The finding of a lower caffeine-mediated vasoconstriction of arteries from SF mice ( Fig. 3 A ) suggests that microgravity adversely affects elevations in smooth muscle cell cytosolic Ca 2+ levels through an impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -release mechanism. This conclusion is supported by the findings of reduced RyR-2 ( Fig. 3 B ) and RyR-3 ( Fig. 3 C ) mRNA levels in the mesenteric arteries from SF mice. These ryanodine receptor subtypes are important for intracellular release of Ca 2+ in smooth muscle cells ( 40 , 41 ). Numerous ground-based studies using HU rats to simulate the effects of microgravity have found deficits in arterial vasoconstriction, including those of the abdominal and thoracic aorta ( 42 – 46 ), pulmonary arteries ( 47 ), femoral arteries ( 46 , 48 , 49 ), skeletal muscle arterioles ( 22 , 50 ) and mesenteric arteries ( 12 , 13 , 51 , 52 ). In mesenteric arteries, Colleran et al. ( 12 ) demonstrated lower NE-, KCl-, and caffeine-induced vasoconstriction, as well as decreased RyR-2 mRNA and protein after 14 d of HU. In addition, ryanodine-sensitive Ca 2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is decreased in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from mesenteric arteries of HU rats ( 53 ). Thus, the mechanism of the microgravity-induced impairment of mesenteric artery vasoconstrictor responsiveness in the present study appears to be consistent with that of ground-based studies with HU rats. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed to underlie reductions in responsiveness of central arteries to NE, including enhanced endothelial-dependent vasodilation (offsetting vasoconstriction), and atrophic vascular remodeling resulting in a reduction in medial wall thickness and medial cross-sectional area. With regard to the first alternatively proposed mechanism, it is possible that arterial hyporesponsiveness to NE with simulated microgravity involves up-regulation of the endothelial NO/cGMP pathway, as differences in vasoconstriction were abolished with the ablation of the endothelial cell lining or inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity ( 42 , 47 ). However, Delp et al. ( 44 ) and Sangha et al. ( 48 ) have demonstrated in the abdominal aorta that the impairment of vasoconstriction persists regardless of whether the endothelium is removed or intact. And in perhaps the most relevant study, Hatton et al. ( 30 ) demonstrated an attenuated relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine in mesenteric arteries of rats after spaceflight, suggesting that endothelium-derived NO bioavailability is depressed rather than enhanced in arteries showing reduced vasoconstrictor responsiveness to NE. The second alternative mechanism for the reduced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric arteries is an atrophic structural remodeling ( 54 , 55 ). Using both histomorphometric techniques and videographic methods in pressurized mesenteric artery segments to determine vessel medial wall thickness, medial cross-sectional area and intraluminal diameter, Lin et al. ( 54 ) have reported a thinner medial wall and diminished medial cross-sectional area with no change in maximal intraluminal diameter in mesenteric arteries from HU rats; this atrophic remodeling was associated with attenuated myogenic KCl- and phenylephrine-evoked vasoconstriction. Others, however, using similar histomorphometric and videographic methodologies, have found no alterations in gross vascular structure of mesenteric arteries in HU rats ( 12 , 13 , 56 ) or spaceflown rats ( 30 ) and mice (present study). Thus, the preponderance of evidence suggests that atrophic structural remodeling cannot account for decrements in vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric arteries in spaceflown and HU rodents. Mechanistic basis for diminished venous constriction Venular pressure-diameter responses are regulated by sympathetic activity in vivo ( 17 ) through α 1 adrenoreceptors ( 57 , 58 ). To our knowledge, the effects of microgravity on intrinsic venoconstrictor function have not been previously studied. Results from the present study demonstrate blunted NE-induced constriction of mesenteric veins ( Fig. 5 A ) across a range of intraluminal pressures ( Fig. 5 B ). These results are consistent with a previous observation of diminished α-receptor density in the vena cava of rats following spaceflight ( 59 ) as a potential mechanism for the diminished venoconstriction. Several studies using HU rats have likewise reported a decreased venoconstriction to NE in the vena cava and mesenteric veins ( 13 , 18 , 59 , 60 ), but not in jugular and femoral veins ( 46 ). Similar to mesenteric arteries, another potential mechanism for spaceflight-associated impairment of venoconstriction is a blunting of intracellular Ca 2+ release through the down-regulation of ryanodine receptors ( 61 ). Indeed, Morel et al. ( 60 ) demonstrated lower intracellular Ca 2+ release in response to NE, angiotensin II, and caffeine in rat portal vein myocytes after 14 d of HU. Further, [ 3 H]ryanodine binding in the same myocytes revealed a reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum-based ryanodine receptors with no change in ryanodine receptor Ca 2+ sensitivity or voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel activity. The primary unanswered question regarding vascular alterations associated with spaceflight is the stimulus for the change. Results from the present and previous studies ( 30 , 31 ) show impaired contraction of smooth muscle cells of arteries and veins from SF rats and mice. In addition, pregnant rats flown on the Cosmos 1514 mission had prolonged labor ( 62 ), and rats flown on Cosmos 1667 had distended stomachs filled with food ( 63 ), indicating the possible impairment of uterine and stomach smooth muscle contraction with spaceflight. Also, lymphatic vascular smooth muscle cells in HU rats demonstrate an impaired ability to constrict ( 64 ). The apparent systemic nature of the smooth muscle dysfunction would seem to rule out local alterations in hydrostatic pressures or intravascular shear-stress as direct effector mechanisms. Rather, alterations in hydrostatic fluid pressures or other spaceflight-associated phenomena could trigger systemic release of some as of yet unknown factors that could be responsible for the smooth muscle dysfunction induced by microgravity. For example, cephalic fluid shifts elicit elevations in circulating levels of numerous substances ( 65 ), including endogenous hormones such as atrial natriuretic peptides (ANPs) and brain natriuretic peptides (BNPs) that serve to regulate fluid volume ( 66 ). We have previously demonstrated that both ANPs and BNPs reduce smooth muscle contractile responses to adrenergic stimulation in mesenteric arteries and veins, and that these peptides are elevated during simulated microgravity ( 13 ). Keil et al. ( 67 ) have also reported that ANP levels were lower in atrial tissue from rats flown on the Cosmos 2044/Bion 9 biosatellite, and suggested that the lower tissue concentrations reflect elevated ANP secretion during flight. However, others have reported unchanged ( 68 ) or decreased ( 69 ) plasma ANP concentrations with simulated microgravity. Therefore, whether these peptides or other circulating factors are responsible for microgravity-induced smooth muscle dysfunction remains to be determined. Time course of arterial recovery from spaceflight Impairment of vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric resistance arteries may underlie, at least in part, the orthostatic hypotension evident in humans following spaceflight (3, 6–9, 70), given that ∼20% of the increase in PVR comes from the splanchnic region on standing ( 71 ). The condition of orthostatic intolerance is usually corrected within 2 d of return to terrestrial gravity, while complete orthostatic recovery is achieved in a length of time equivalent to that of flight operations ( 5 ). Using ground-based models of simulated microgravity, structural and functional adaptations of arteries in various vascular beds require several days before either partial or full return to that observed in control animals ( 55 ). Results from the present study demonstrate that reductions in NE-induced vasoconstriction persist 1 d after spaceflight ( Fig. 4 A ), but return to control levels within 5 d of ground recovery ( Fig. 4 B ). The precise mechanisms for the recovered vasoconstriction are presently unknown, but the time frame of recovery ( i.e ., 2–5 d) is similar to that required to fully restore ryanodine receptor function and caffeine-induced Ca 2+ release in mesenteric artery vascular smooth muscle cells after simulated microgravity ( 53 ). Functional ramifications of vasomotor alterations Stroke volume has been shown to be diminished during orthostasis following spaceflight ( 5 , 15 ). Because stroke volume is affected by cardiac contractility and venous filling pressure, a blunting of the magnitude and rate of arterial vasoconstriction would not only affect PVR, but also compromise central venous filling pressure by increasing the volume of blood located within peripheral arterioles, venules, and small veins ( 71 ). Given the prodigious vascular capacitance of the splanchnic region ( 16 ), a diminished mesenteric vasoconstriction after spaceflight in humans could impair central mobilization of blood volume to support stroke volume and cardiac output. Indeed, a compromised ability to lower perfusion of splanchnic areas during lower-body negative pressure has been shown to occur following prolonged bedrest ( 10 , 11 ). Intact vasoconstrictor mechanisms are also required for the redistribution of cardiac output away from visceral tissue to active skeletal muscles during exercise ( 71 , 72 ). Thus, an impaired ability to reduce visceral blood flow in HU rats ( 14 , 51 ) would adversely affect aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance. Therefore, dysfunction of vaso- and venoconstrictor mechanisms within the splanchnic vasculature in astronauts likely plays a fundamental role in the altered hemodynamics during exercise and orthostasis upon return to Earth.",
