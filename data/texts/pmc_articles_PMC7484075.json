    "Abstract": "The whole-genome sequences of 26 strains isolated from the International Space Station were generated, and the strains were identified as being members of the order Enterobacteriales. Characterization of these whole-genome sequences might enable the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria that have been adapting to the space environment.",
