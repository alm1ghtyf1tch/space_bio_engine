    "Abstract": "Abstract Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum ( ob/ob ) , and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob ). Mice were maintained at 32°C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice. These findings demonstrate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obese ob/ob mice.

    "Results": "The effects of pair feeding (to match food intake in WT mice) on body weight and cumulative food intake, and on abdominal WAT weight, blood glucose levels, uterine weight, and serum osteocalcin and CTx levels at sacrifice in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice housed at thermoneutral temperature are shown in Figure 1 . Six-week-old ob/ob mice were heavier than their age-matched WT littermates at start of treatment and gained more weight than the WT mice during the 12-week study ( Figures 1A and B ). ob/ob mice were hyperphagic consuming, on average, twice as much food as WT mice ( Figure 1C ). At termination of study, the ob/ob mice had more abdominal WAT ( Figure 1D ), and were hyperglycemic ( Figure 1E ) and hypogonadal ( Figure 1F ) compared to WT mice. Figure 1.

Values are mean ± SE, n=10–11/group. ND, no data due to insufficient serum for measurement of CTx in pair-fed ob/ob mice. a Different from WT mice, p < 0.05. b Different from ob/ob mice, p < 0.05. Pair-fed ob/ob mice had lower body weight and body weight gain, lower cumulative food intake, lower abdominal WAT weight, lower blood glucose levels, and slightly lower uterine weight than ob/ob mice. Pair-feeding abolished differences in weight gain and blood glucose levels between WT and ob/ob mice. However, the pair-fed ob/ob mice were still heavier, had more WAT, and were hypogonadal compared to WT mice. Effects of pair feeding on serum markers of bone turnover in ob/ob mice Serum levels of osteocalcin ( Figure 1G ) and CTx ( Figure 1H ) were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Also, pair-fed ob/ob mice had lower serum osteocalcin levels than either WT or ob/ob mice. Insufficient serum was available for measurement of CTx in pair-fed ob/ob mice. Effects of pair feeding on bone mass and architecture in ob/ob mice The effects of pair feeding on femur BMC, area and BMD, and on femur length, bone volume, and cortical and cancellous bone architecture in ob/ob mice are shown in Table 1 . ob/ob mice had lower femur BMC, bone area, and BMD than WT mice. Pair-fed ob/ob mice had lower BMC and bone area than WT or ob/ob mice. Significant differences in BMD were not detected between ob/ob and pair-fed ob/ob mice. Table 1.

Cortical bone in midshaft femur ob/ob mice had lower cortical bone volume and cortical thickness than WT mice. Pair-fed ob/ob mice had lower midshaft femur cortical bone volume and cortical thickness, and greater marrow volume than WT or ob/ob mice. Significant differences in cross-sectional volume and polar moment of inertia were not detected among groups. Cancellous bone in distal femur metaphysis ob/ob mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, and trabecular number, and lower trabecular separation than WT mice.

Cancellous bone in distal femur epiphysis ob/ob mice and pair-fed ob/ob mice had higher bone volume fraction, connectivity density, and trabecular number, and lower trabecular thickness and separation than WT mice. Differences between ob/ob mice and pair-fed ob/ob mice were not detected for any epiphyseal endpoint measured. The effects of pair feeding on cancellous bone mass and architecture in lumbar vertebra in ob/ob mice are shown in Table 1 . ob/ob mice had higher cancellous bone volume fraction, connectivity density, and trabecular number, and lower trabecular separation than WT mice. Pair-fed ob/ob mice had higher bone volume fraction than WT mice and a tendency (p < 0.1) for higher bone volume fraction than ob/ob mice. Also, pair-fed ob/ob mice had higher trabecular thickness than WT or ob/ob mice. Connectivity density was lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice than in ob/ob mice but did not differ from WT mice. Trabecular number was higher and trabecular separation was lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice than WT mice. Differences in trabecular number and separation were not detected between ob/ob mice and pair-fed ob/ob mice. Effects of pair feeding on bone histomorphometry in ob/ob mice Cancellous bone in distal femur metaphysis The effects of pair feeding on dynamic and static cancellous bone histomorphometry and marrow adiposity in the distal femur metaphysis in ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 2 . ob/ob mice had lower mineralizing perimeter ( Figure 2A ), mineral apposition rate ( Figure 2B ), bone formation rate ( Figure 2C ), and osteoblast perimeter ( Figure 2D ) compared to WT mice. Pair-fed ob/ob mice had lower mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate, and osteoblast perimeter than WT or ob/ob mice. Differences in osteoclast perimeter ( Figure 2E ) were not detected with treatment. However, cartilage area ( Figure 2F ), an index of impaired bone resorption, was higher in both groups of ob/ob mice compared to WT mice. Bone marrow adiposity ( Figure 2G ) tended (p < 0.1) to be greater in ob/ob mice than WT mice and was greater in pair-fed ob/ob mice than in WT or ob/ob mice. Adipocyte density ( Figure 2H ) was higher in pair-fed ob/ob mice than in ob/ob mice. Representative photomicrographs of marrow adipocytes in the 3 groups of mice are shown in Figure 3A–C . Figure 2.

Effects of pair feeding on gene expression in tibia The effects of pair feeding on expression of 84 genes related to osteogenesis in tibia are shown in Figure 6 . Compared to WT mice, expression levels of 24 genes were altered in ob/ob mice (7 higher and 17 lower) and 26 genes in pair-fed ob/ob mice (10 higher and 16 lower). The expression levels of 14 genes were altered in common in ob/ob and pair-fed ob/ob mice. Compared to ob/ob mice, expression levels of 11 genes (3 higher and 8 lower) were altered in pair-fed ob/ob mice. ob/ob mice exhibited reductions in several key genes related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function, including Sp7/osterix (−2.5 fold), NfκB1 (−1.2 fold), alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) (−1.5 fold), Itgam (CD11b) (−1.3 fold) and osteocalcin (Bglap) (−1.8 fold). ob/ob mice also exhibited reductions in genes related to cartilage formation and maturation, including col2a1 (−1.5 fold) and col10a1 (−1.7 fold). Genes whose expression were elevated include Bmpr1a (+1.3 fold) and Smad4 (+1.3 fold). Compared to WT mice, pair-fed ob/ob mice expressed even lower levels of osteocalcin (−3.8 fold) than observed in ob/ob mice and, in addition, had lower mRNA levels for the osteoclast differentiation factor Csf1 (−1.5 fold) and osteoblast differentiation factor Runx2 (−1.4 fold). Furthermore, compared to WT mice, pair-fed ob/ob mice had higher gene expression levels for the cytokines/growth factors TNFa (+1.6 fold) and TGFB2 (+1.3 fold). Figure 6.

    "Conclusion": "We investigated the contribution of excessive weight gain to the skeletal phenotype of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Mice were housed at 32°C and a group of ob/ob mice was pair-fed to WT mice. Housing mice at 32°C, which is within the thermoneutral range for WT and ob/ob mice, was expected to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure and pair feeding ob/ob mice to WT mice was expected to equalize energy intake ( Knehans and Romsos 1982 ; Rafael and Herling 2000 ). The parallel increase in body weight gain in WT mice and ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice over the 12-week duration of study demonstrates the efficacy of this approach for preventing development of morbid obesity in leptin-deficient mice. Consistent with earlier studies ( Ealey et al. 2006 ; Hamrick et al. 2004 ; Iwaniec et al. 2007 ; Williams et al. 2011 ), ob/ob mice exhibited a mosaic skeletal phenotype associated with decreased bone formation due to reduced osteoblast number and activity, and defective osteoclast function. Femurs from ob/ob mice were smaller and had thinner cortices than those from WT mice. Furthermore, serum osteocalcin levels, mRNA levels for osteocalcin and SP7 (osterix), osteoblast perimeter and dynamic indices of bone formation were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. However, cancellous bone volume fraction in both distal femur and lumbar vertebra was higher in the ob/ob mice. The higher cancellous bone volume fraction was associated with (1) greatly reduced serum CTx levels, (2) reductions in mRNA levels for NFKB, Itgam and Icam1, (3) retention of calcified cartilage, and (4) retention of fluorochrome label administered at study initiation, all indicative of a defect in bone resorption. Osteoclast perimeter was either unaffected (distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra) or increased (distal femur epiphysis), indicating that reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice was not due to an inability to generate osteoclasts. Taken together, these findings further support our previous observation that ob/ob mice exhibit mild osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis due to a defect in osteoclast function may be responsible for the poor bone quality ( Ealey et al. 2006 ) and defective tooth eruption ( Batt 1978 , 1992 ) reported in ob/ob mice. Pair-feeding accentuated many of the abnormalities in bone size, mass, microarchitecture, gene expression, and turnover typically observed in ob/ob mice. Thus, chronic excessive weight gain typically present in ob/ob mice reduces the magnitude of skeletal effects associated with leptin deficiency. We did not adjust μCT-derived cortical bone data for body weight differences because the association between body weight and bone size and density in growing mice varies with bone and bone compartment and this association is altered by leptin ( Iwaniec, et al. 2009 ). However, it is clear that the weight gain due to hyperphagia in ob/ob mice was associated with increases in cortical bone accrual but that these gains were not commensurate with the magnitude of body weight gain. The mechanisms for the partial protective effect of morbid obesity on bone in ob/ob mice are likely to be multifactorial. We have previously reported a strong positive correlation between body weight and total femur bone mass in ob/ob mice ( Iwaniec et al. 2009 ). This finding provides strong evidence that the higher total and cortical bone mass in ad libitum -fed compared to pair-fed ob/ob mice are, at least in part, attributable to higher body weight. Although there have been significant recent advances in our understanding of regulation of bone metabolism by mechanotransduction, the molecular mechanism for this positive effect of weight on bone mass is largely unknown. In addition to direct effects of increased mechanical loading, changes in levels of hormones and/or growth factors may mediate additional effects of increased weight on the skeleton ( Robling 2012 ). We did not measure levels of insulin, glucocorticoids, or norepinephrine, factors known to be dysregulated in ob/ob mice ( Dubuc, et al. 1985 ; Kim and Romsos 1990 ; Knehans and Romsos 1982 ; Rafael and Herling 2000 ) and known to influence bone metabolism. However, housing food-restricted ob/ob mice at thermoneutral temperature has been reported to reduce abnormalities in blood glucose, insulin, glucocorticoids, and norepinephrine turnover. In contrast, ad libitum -fed ob/ob mice were reported to remain hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic ( Lindstrom 2007 ). We confirmed that blood glucose levels in pair-fed ob/ob mice did not differ from WT mice and were much lower than in ad-libitum -fed ob/ob mice. The contribution of excess insulin secretion and other factors associated with morbid obesity to the protective effects of excess body weight ( Hickman and McElduff 1990 ; Ituarte, et al. 1988 ; Martineau-Doize, et al. 1986 ; Pun, et al. 1989 ; Yaturu 2009 ) on cortical bone microarchitecture in ob/ob mice requires further investigation. Leptin is required for gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion ( Donato, et al. 2011 ). As a consequence, ob/ob mice are severely hypogonadal ( Chehab, et al. 2002 ). The resulting deficiency in sex steroids would be expected to play a role in the pathological skeletal changes associated with leptin deficiency because sex steroids, especially estrogen, contribute to the sexual dimorphism of the female skeleton and regulate bone turnover balance in adults ( Rickard, et al. 2008 ; Turner, et al. 1989 ; Turner, et al. 1994 ). Gonadal dysfunction typically results in elevated bone turnover and cancellous osteopenia. The difference between the skeletal responses to gonadal hormone insufficiency resulting from gonadectomy (high turnover) and from leptin-deficiency (low turnover) is perplexing. However, estrogen has a tonic effect on bone resorption and leptin is required for normal osteoclast function. As a consequence, high bone turnover generally associated with estrogen deficiency may be attenuated in ob/ob mice due to impaired osteoclast function. We speculate that the requirement for leptin in normal osteoclast function may serve as a counter regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive bone loss during fasting. We did not measure sex steroid levels but the higher uterine weight in ad libitum -fed ob/ob mice compared to pair-fed ob/ob mice implies that morbid obesity results in a small increase in circulating estrogen. Higher estrogen levels in blood or adipose tissue may contribute to the protective skeletal effects of morbid obesity ( Gennari, et al. 2011 ; Turner 1999 ; Turner et al. 1994 ). Aromatase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of androgens to estrogens, is expressed by adipocytes ( Gennari et al. 2011 ). Thus, adipose-derived estrogen is a plausible mechanism contributing to the skeletal differences between pair-fed and ad libitum -fed ob/ob mice. Initially heavier, ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice remained heavier than WT mice for the duration of study. We chose to equalize energy availability rather than body weight in the present study because bone accrual in rapidly growing rodents is strongly associated with energy availability and bone loss accompanies weight loss in adults ( Devlin, et al. 2010 ; Turner and Iwaniec 2011 ). Low leptin levels induced by caloric restriction are associated with diminished bone mass accrual whereas partial leptin signaling deficiency induced in ad lib -fed mice by treatment with a leptin antagonist increased body weight and bone mass accrual ( Solomon, et al. 2014 ). However, administration of leptin increases bone formation in adult ob/ob mice in spite of weight loss ( Bartell et al. 2011 ; Turner et al. 2013 ). Thus, both adequate energy availability and leptin play important roles in bone accrual in growing mice. In contrast to peripheral fat depots, which act as dynamic energy reservoirs to maintain circulating triglyceride and free fatty acid levels during feeding and fasting, marrow fat increases with severe weight loss as well as weight gain ( Bredella, et al. 2011 ; Devlin 2011 ). It is therefore unlikely that the bone marrow fat depot serves as an important energy reservoir for peripheral tissues. There is, however, evidence that bone marrow adipocytes function as negative regulators of hematopoietic lineage cell differentiation ( Dorshkind, et al. 2009 ; Gimble, et al. 1996 ; Naveiras, et al. 2009 ). Bone marrow fat is increased in ob/ob mice and this increase is reversed by leptin treatment ( Bartell et al. 2011 ; Hamrick, et al. 2005 ; Hamrick et al. 2004 ). Leptin stimulates hematopoiesis ( Fantuzzi and Faggioni 2000 ; Trottier, et al. 2012 ), an action that may be due to inhibition of bone marrow adipogenesis, increased lipolysis, and direct stimulatory actions on hematopoietic cells. Adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from the same bone marrow mesenchymal precursor and a reciprocal association between osteoblast number and adipocyte number has often been noted, giving rise to the hypothesis that bone marrow adipocytes may either antagonize osteoblast production or, alternatively, generation of adipocytes precludes generation of osteoblasts ( Akune, et al. 2004 ). Other studies suggest that adipocyte and osteoblast number in bone marrow can be independently regulated ( Iwaniec and Turner 2013 ; Menagh et al. 2010 ). Bartell et al. (2011) reported that intracerebroventricular administration of leptin to ob/ob mice increases expression of SP7, a transcription factor critical for osteoblast differentiation. Our findings of low expression of SP7 in ob/ob mice support the hypothesis that leptin acts to regulate bone formation by controlling mesenchymal cell decision. In the present study, pair feeding to WT mice resulted in a further increase in bone marrow adiposity in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Of interest is our finding that pair-fed ob/ob mice had elevated mRNA levels for CD36; CD36 (fatty acid translocase) promotes adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis ( Christiaens, et al. 2012 ). The observed increase in CD36 may play a role in the increased bone marrow adiposity observed in the pair-fed ob/ob mice. Additional factors regulating bone marrow adiposity that may be influenced by leptin levels and obesity include growth hormone and IGF1. In rats, treatment with parathyroid hormone (whose actions on bone are largely mediated through IGF1) prevented the increase in bone marrow adiposity associated with severe energy restriction ( Turner and Iwaniec 2011 ), whereas growth hormone treatment dramatically reduced excessive bone marrow adiposity in severely hypoleptinemic hypophysectomized rats ( Menagh et al. 2010 ). In both of these studies, treatment had no effect on serum leptin levels. ob/ob mice, however, have decreased circulating growth hormone and impaired growth hormone signaling ( Luque, et al. 2007 ), likely contributing to retention of fat within the bone marrow. High circulating insulin levels in morbidly obese ob/ob mice may further contribute to the suppression of growth hormone synthesis and release ( Luque and Kineman 2006 ). However, IGF1 is produced and secreted by adipocytes ( Kloting, et al. 2008 ) and higher levels of IGF1 are detected in obese subjects ( Frystyk, et al. 1999 ). Low leptin levels resulting from severe energy restriction are associated with increased growth hormone secretion, decreased circulating levels of IGF1, and end-organ resistance to growth hormone ( Douyon and Schteingart 2002 ; Grinspoon, et al. 1995 ; Inagaki, et al. 2008 ; Munoz and Argente 2002 ; Thissen, et al. 1999 ). Thus, disturbances in growth hormone, IGF1 and insulin signaling as well as leptin deficiency may contribute to the increase in bone marrow adiposity in ob/ob mice. Chronic hyperphagia and excessive weight gain typically observed in ob/ob mice may partially compensate for leptin deficiency and reduced bone marrow adiposity by altering growth hormone and insulin levels and sensitivity. In summary, leptin deficiency resulted in decreased femur length, BMC, BMD, and cortical bone volume and thickness. In contrast, cancellous bone volume fraction was increased in distal femur and lumbar vertebra. The profound changes in bone mass, density, and microarchitecture were associated with reduced linear bone growth, increased bone marrow adiposity, altered expression of osteogenic genes, decreased osteoblast number, and decreased osteoclast function. Prevention of morbid obesity in ob/ob mice further exacerbated many of the abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency. Because morbid obesity normally present in ob/ob mice attenuates the abnormal skeletal phenotype associated with leptin deficiency, the role of leptin in regulating postnatal bone growth, maturation, and turnover may have been underestimated.",
