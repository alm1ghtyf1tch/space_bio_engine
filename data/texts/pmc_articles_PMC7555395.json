    "Abstract": "Abstract During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (μ G ) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μ G on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μ G . However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and μ G . In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μ G conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μ G simultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1 G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μ G conditions. Keywords: lymphoblast, microgravity, space radiation, chromosome aberration",
    "Results": "3.1. Cell Survival Figure 2 a shows the growth of TK6 cells cultured in regular RPMI medium in a CO 2 incubator and COI medium. Compared to the RPMI medium, cell growth was slower in the COI medium. Under the culturing condition using the COI medium, the doubling time was 24 h. Figure 2 b shows the survival fraction irradiated by X-ray and 290 MeV/n C-ion under the static condition. Since cells were irradiated by 0.2-s pulses under simulated μ G and at 1 G static condition, the survival study was conducted using the 0.2-s pulse exposure, as well as continuous exposure. After maintaining μ G or 1 G condition for 24 h and irradiation, the unirradiated cell numbers of 1 G condition were 1.28 × 10 5 ± 0.222 cells/mL, while the unirradiated cell numbers under μ G condition were 1.17 × 10 5 ± 0.354 cells/mL. For each dose level, the cumulative dose of pulse irradiation was the same as that of continuous exposure. There was no significant difference in the survival fraction between μ G and 1 G . Compared to the survival curve for cells irradiated by X-ray which showed a shoulder, the exponential survival curve for C-ion had no such shoulder. C-ion was more lethal than X-ray per unit dose.

The error bar indicated the standard error of the mean. n = 3 for each time point. ( b ) Survival fraction of TK6 cells irradiated by 0.2 s pulses of X-ray (blue circle) or 290 MeV/n C-ion (red triangle) under the μ G (unfilled) or 1 G (filled) condition. Experimental data represent the mean of two to three plates for each dose experiment. Under the pulse irradiation mode, a total dose of 0.5 Gy C-ion beam exposure and 1.1 Gy X-ray exposure resulted in similar cell survival. We also found that 0.25 Gy C-ion beam exposure and 0.5 Gy X-ray exposure had similar cell survival fraction. Based on these results, we selected the cumulative doses of 0.5 Gy, 1.1 Gy and 1.5 Gy for X-ray, 0.25 Gy and 0.5 Gy for C-ion, to assess the combined effect of simulated μ G and radiation on CA in TK6 cells. 3.2. CA Figure 3 shows 3-color chromosome FISH images, in which chromosome 1 (red), chromosome 2 (green) and chromosome 4 (yellow) are stained. All chromosomes were stained by DAPI (blue). Figure 3 a shows normal chromosome with no damages. Other panels show chromosomes that are damaged in various ways (see figure legend). All types of detectable aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were scored, and the whole-genome equivalent frequencies of aberrations were calculated. Figure 3. Open in a new tab Examples of 3-color whole-chromosome FISH staining images of TK6 cells: chromosome 1 (red), chromosome 2 (green) and chromosome 4 (yellow). CA are identified by arrows as simple (reciprocal exchanges between two chromosomes) or complex-type exchanges (three or more breaks in two or more chromosomes).

Table 1 shows the total exchanges analyzed in this study. Chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 consist of roughly 40% of the nuclear DNA. The frequencies of CA obtained from chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were converted to the whole nuclear DNA equivalent. Table 1.

Figure 4 shows the relationship between irradiation doses and total exchanges. For each source of radiation, the frequency of CA increased with dose. The frequency of CA increased in cells exposed under the μ G condition compared to those exposed under the static condition. At the same irradiation dose, CA was more frequently observed in C-ion irradiated cells than in X-ray irradiated counter parts. Furthermore, at the iso-survival fraction dose, C-ion irradiation produced more CA than X-ray irradiation. Figure 4.

    "Conclusion": "Humans will face the unique environment in space, represented by both μ G and the space radiation, which contains a wide variety of ion species with various ranges of energy. It is challenging to simulate these space environments in one’s laboratory. Although many studies have reported the increased sensitivity of cells to radiation and decreased levels of DNA repair under simulated μ G , most of these studies were performed using X-ray or γ-ray [ 16 ]. In the future Mars missions, GCR exposure, made up of high-energy and charged nuclei, will be of more serious concern than low linear energy transfer (LET) exposure. For this reason, it is important to investigate the effects of both low- and high-LET exposure under the μ G . In our previous studies, we have shown changes in cell cycle-related genes expression [ 19 ] and increased frequency of CA [ 20 ] in human fibroblasts using our unique SSS [ 17 , 18 ]. CA data obtained from chromosome 1, 2 and 4 were extrapolated to the whole genome using a modified version of the equation of Lucas et al. [ 36 ]. Originally, Lucas reported the formula to calculate whole- genome exchange frequency based on low-LET radiation exposure. Although damages caused by high-LET exposure were expected to different form damages induced by low-LET exposure, we applied this modified formula in many cases of single-mono energetic ion beams in various LET, as well as mixed beam [ 33 , 37 , 38 ], and the results were in good agreement with the CA frequencies simulated by Monte Carlo modeling both single beam and mixed beams [ 39 , 40 , 41 ]. This formula is applicable to high-LET exposure in the range of doses we used in this study. CA has been shown to increase in the lymphocytes of astronauts after long missions lasting for several months in space [ 42 , 43 , 44 ]. CA is positively correlated with increased incidents of cancer [ 43 , 44 , 45 ]. Therefore, CA is a gold standard in the biodosimetry for radiation, and has been used for the risk assessment of space radiation. To follow up our previous study with adherent 1BR-hTERT cells [ 20 ], we used non-adherent TK6 cells to investigate whether the similar combined effect of radiation and μ G on CA frequency is observed. Compared to the cells exposed to radiation only, higher frequencies of CA were found in TK6 cells under the condition of simultaneous exposure to radiation and μ G ( Figure 4 ). Our study indicates that this combined effect is independent of radiation types, as both X-ray and C-ion beams were more detrimental under μ G than 1 G . Thus, our study suggests that the effects of ionizing radiation and μ G are more than additive and that astronauts’ risk of CA increases during long space flights. We observed higher frequencies of CA in TK6 cells with the same dose of irradiation. Under the same survival fraction dose, we detected increased incidence of the complex type of CA in TK6 cells, although the frequency of total CA was similar between TK6 cells and 1BR-hTERT cells. It is not clear if this difference is due to higher radio sensitivity of TK6 cells than that of 1BR-hTERT or due to the way these cells are cultured: adherent and floating. It is reported that there was wide variation in chromatid break frequencies, but it was only slightly higher than that reported for primary human cells in TK6. The dicentric frequency was more than 10-fold higher for TK6 cells than that reported for normal primary human cells. TK6 cells also show much higher levels of non-reciprocal chromosome translocations than are usually observed in primary human cells [ 46 ]. The higher frequency of the complexed exchanges in TK6 compare to fibroblasts in our study supports a previous report. The extent of the combined effect might depend on the cell types. Further investigation is needed sing different cell types. Manti et al. reported no effects of simulated μ G on CA in human lymphocytes irradiated with X-ray or proton beam [ 47 ], whereas Mosesso et al. showed increased CA in human lymphocytes irradiated by 1.5 Gy of X-ray [ 48 ]. Our results on both adherent [ 20 ] and floating (current study) cells support the results of Mosesso et al. [ 48 ]. More importantly, we have observed these effects, not only with X-ray exposure, but also with relatively low dose of C-ion exposure as well, which is more relevant for the condition in the ISS [ 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 ]. These results support the reports of increased genomic damages in human lymphoblasts exposed to ionizing radiation under simulated μ G conditions compared to 1 G [ 53 , 54 ]. Based on the cell survival analysis, we irradiated cells with the doses that induce the same survival fraction. Compared to the cell irradiated with X-ray, higher frequencies of CA were observed with C-ion irradiation. It is well known that CA induction by heavy ions indicates a higher frequency of complex exchanged compare to low-LET radiation, and the observed rearrangements are of greater complexity [ 55 ]. The complex type of CA observed in cells irradiated with C-ion are higher compare to irradiated to X-ray both under μ G and 1 G in this study. Monte Carlo simulations as well as various other experiments indicate that complex DNA lesions with multiple damage sites, including double strand breaks, single strand breaks, and other damages within one or two helical turns referred to as clustered DNA damage are caused by heavy ion irradiation [ 56 , 57 ]. DNA breaks by X-ray irradiation are much less clustered, and it is likely to be repaired properly. Since clustered DNA breaks are difficult to correctly repair, breaks made by heavy ion irradiation are more likely to cause CAs. In this study, no significant difference was observed in cell survival between μ G and 1 G , suggesting that the extent of all cause cell death including apoptosis is the same. Since the frequency of CAs was greatly increased by simultaneous exposure to simulated μ G and radiation compared to radiation alone, it is possible that cells were proliferating with unrepaired CA. For the survival fraction analysis in this study, cells were first acclimatized to the simulated μ G or 1 G condition, then irradiated under the respective gravitational condition, and seeded for culturing at 1 G immediately after irradiation ( Figure 1 ). The exact reasons for increased CA under simulated μ G have not been fully elucidated to date. Previous studies suggest that the expression of DNA repair genes was decreased in human lymphoblasts grown under simulated μ G [ 58 ], and that CA in human peripheral blood lymphocytes were enhanced by simulated μ G through inhibition of DNA repair [ 59 ]. These results appear to establish correlation between decreased expression of DNA repair genes and CA found in cells exposed to μ G . In our previous study, we found decreased cell cycle-suppressing gene and increased cell cycle-promoting genes on human fibroblasts grown under μ G and C-ion irradiation. It was suggested that cells containing DNA damages induced by the combined stimulation with μ G and C-ion may be allowed to rapidly pass through the cell cycle checkpoints without complete DNA repair, and that this may induce increased CA in these cells [ 19 ]. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Although comparison of simulated μ G and 1 G in each dose did not have enough statistical power to show significant difference (only 3 cases sowed p < 0.05 in Table 1 ), the multivariate logistical regression analysis provided significant contributions of μ G in frequency of total exchanges ( Table 2 ). Independent of radiation exposure dose, simulated μ G cause 1.635 and 1.487 times of total exchanges, in comparison to 1 G under X-ray and C-ion radiation exposure, respectively ( Table 2 ). Taken together, our results discussed above indicate that the effects of μ G and radiation are more than additive. We are aware that results from in vitro studies cannot be directly applied to in vivo biological events. The ground-based simulated μ G does not exactly recapitulate the μ G in space. However, there is limited access for spaceflight experiments. It is difficult to perform a sufficient number of replicated experiments in space to establish statistical significance. Additionally, experiments on the ISS do not give a deep space radiation environment. Thus, it is important to perform ground-based experiments using various devices that simulate the simultaneous exposure of cells and animals to μ G and radiation. We trust that the results from such studies will be useful in assessing various risks of space travel, and eventually coming up with means of mitigation. Further investigations are in progress. Furthermore, we anticipate that our experimental results will corroborate the recent model calculations of radiation risk uncertainties [ 60 ].",
