    "Abstract": "Abstract Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase ( ADT ) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated “omics” analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes–highly correlated to stem lignin levels–deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ , with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.

    "Results": "A multi-omics evaluation of Arabidopsis ADT KO mutant lines (compared to WT plants) was conducted at 4 weeks of growth/development, when the plants had fully developed rosette leaves and had stems about 10–20 cm high (∼1/3 height at maturity). For both tissue types, full RNA-Seq transcriptomics, iTRAQ 8-plex multiplexing proteomics coupled with LC-MS/MS, together with primary (GC-MS) and secondary (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed. Data interrogation resulted in confident detection (1% FDR) of 27,181 transcripts, 8,672 proteins, together with 132 primary and 30 secondary metabolites. Normalization of Expression Data for Multi-Omics Integration Each biomolecular class (i.e., transcripts, proteins, and metabolites) was measured using disparate workflows. Since only a few replicate analyses were feasible, as is typical for RNA-Seq and proteome analysis, variance estimations were offset by “borrowing” information from genes or proteins across the entire analysis ( Subramaniam and Hsiao, 2012 ). The general rationale for this approach relied on the assumption that variance is similar for biomolecules of similar abundances. Transcript or peptide measurements with similar abundances can therefore act as pseudo-replicates producing similar distribution parameters. This strategy is commonly utilized for expression data and with various bioinformatics tools [e.g., SAM ( Tusher et al., 2001 ), limma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 ), and VAMPIRE ( Hsiao et al., 2005 )]. We applied this approach to log 2 fold change transcriptome, proteome and metabolome data between each ADT KO mutant and WT analysis. Data were first processed as MA-plots ( Dudoit et al., 2002 ; Labbe and Dudoit, 2012 ) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), an approach that distributes log 2 fold change data ( M = y -axis) according to average abundance ( A = x -axis) of the two measurements being compared. Log 2 fold change calculations for any type of expression data (gene/protein/metabolite) typically form a normal distribution, with subsequent utilization of localized data (or a sliding window of log 2 fold change data with similar abundances) enabling calculation of more accurate z -scores and p -values for significance estimations. Resulting z -score calculations then allowed for normalization of data into units of standard deviation (away from an average or zero-fold change value). This normalization then permits integration of datasets obtained on disparate platforms (i.e., Illumina sequencing, mass spectrometry) to be compared directly. Metabolomics Analysis Metabolite profiles represent the ultimate molecular phenotypic indicator of an organism at a specific growth/developmental stage. Metabolites often function as cofactors, energy sources, signaling molecules, polymer precursors (e.g., to cellulose, lignins, proteins, DNA), as well as defense, attractant and effector molecules. In the context of plant bioengineering, metabolomic analyses provide the ultimate validation as to which metabolites are increased or decreased in quantity in response to a genetic change or other perturbation. Here we used two mass spectrometric methods to evaluate the differences between each ADT KO mutant and WT in terms of both primary and secondary metabolism. Supplementary Figures 2 , 3 show heat maps displaying z -scores of log 2 fold changes between ADT KO mutants and WT for the metabolites identified by GC-MS (i.e., primary metabolites) and LC-MS (i.e., secondary metabolites), respectively. Data were grouped by functional categories, as defined by KEGG 8 ( Kanehisa et al., 2017 ), when available. Z -score values pertaining to Supplementary Figures 2 , 3 are found in Supplementary Table 1 . The GC-MS results ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) are shown as a heat map displaying z -score of the log 2 fold change values of each metabolite found in each ADT KO mutant compared to WT. The largest primary metabolite classes identified were related to carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids. Fold-changes found in the carbohydrate class included on average decreases in ascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 2.3 in stem) and dehydroascorbate (2.6 in leaf, 1.5 in stem). While not detected in leaf tissue, melibiose (3.2 fold), and xylitol (2.3 fold) were lower in abundance in the stems. In both leaf and stem tissues, the most significant change of all metabolites identified from GC-MS data was that of an increase in sorbitol (5.9 fold in leaf, 152 fold in stem). Knocking out even a single ADT isoform in Arabidopsis has profound effects on sorbitol biosynthesis, and perhaps on a plant-wide level. Jain et al. (2010) reported that treatment of maize seedlings with increased concentrations of sorbitol (a) decreased total chlorophyll, protein and RNA contents, while increasing proline levels and nitrate reductase activity; and (b) induced a stress response that overall inhibited maize growth. By producing so much sorbitol in vivo , ADT KO mutants may too be experiencing changes in chlorophyll, protein and RNA levels. Moreover, these plant lines may also be under increased levels of stress relative to WT plants. Glycolic acid (2.1 fold in leaf and 2.3 fold in stem) additionally was found to be increased in ADT KO mutants versus WT. Glycolic acid is produced when ribulose bisphosphate (RuBisCo) fixes O 2 instead of CO 2 . The increased presence of glycolic acid in both leaf and stem tissues suggests increased photorespiration pathway utilization, which results in a release of CO 2 back to the atmosphere. In stem tissue, other carbohydrates such as D-glyceric acid (2.8 fold), 6-deoxy- D -glucose (10.1 fold), and fructose-6-phosphate (4.1 fold) also had higher levels in ADT KO lines versus WT, whereas significantly increased levels of D-glucoheptose (36.1 fold), allose (4.0 fold), gluconic lactone (3.5 fold), sorbose (2.5 fold), threonic acid (7.3 fold), and glucose-1-phosphate (3.9 fold) were observed in leaves. Amino acids with the most increased levels in the ADT KO mutants versus WT stem tissues included allothreonine (4.2 fold), alanine (2.3 fold), and glutamate (2.2 fold). By contrast, decreases in the ADT KO lines were found for oxoproline (2.4 fold) in the stems. Interestingly, shikimate which is a key metabolite located in the aromatic amino acid/shikimate chorismate pathways upstream of ADT, was, on average, increased (2.6 fold) in ADT KO mutant leaves, but decreased (8.3 fold) in abundance in stem tissues. The LC-MS metabolomics analysis of hydro-alcoholic extracts of leaves and stems led to the detection of numerous important secondary metabolites ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). This approach was chosen based on previous knowledge of important and characteristic metabolites produced by A. thaliana , which include flavonoids, phenylpropanoids (e.g., sinapate esters, lignans) and glucosinolates. We found that putative galactolipids and carotenoids generally increased in abundance in both tissues, whereas most of the identified flavonoids, 1- O -β- D -glucopyranosyl sinapate, 5-hydroxyferuloyl malate and lignans (e.g., putative dimeric coniferyl-OH hexoside), generally decreased in abundance most prominently in the stem tissues, with the greatest reductions being in stems with single or multiple KOs of ADT5 . Nine glucosinolates, which are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing metabolites synthesized by plants as defense against herbivory and pathogens, were also identified. Glucosinolates derived from homomethione (i.e., glucoiberin, glucohirsutin, 7-methylsulfinylheptylglucosinolate, and glucohesperalin) generally decreased in abundance in the ADT KO mutants compared to WT, whereas those derived from Trp or Phe showed mixed abundance changes depending on the ADT KO mutant and tissue type. Glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin and 1-methoxyglucobrassicin, all derived from Trp, showed increases and decreases depending on the specific ADT KO mutant analyzed. 4-Methoxyglucobrassicin (Trp derived) increased in abundance in most ADT KO mutants leaf samples, and in most of the double/triple/quadruple ADT KO mutants as well as in adt5 . Ties between glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids, with lignin being synthesized in the phenylpropanoid pathway, have been previously documented in the literature, suggesting that there is a strong link between these two pathways. For example, Kim et al. (2015) identified an indole glucosinolate which limits phenylpropanoid accumulation via an inhibitory effect on early steps of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis Various metabolites can often be synthesized or metabolized by one or more isoenzymes contained in distinct plant compartments and/or expressed at different times within a plant’s lifespan. This makes metabolite identification and quantification alone not entirely sufficient to convey key information on specific gene/enzyme targets necessary for full understanding of a system or for bioengineering purposes. For this reason, transcriptomics and proteomics prove to be invaluable for identifying significantly affected pathways, specific gene/enzyme targets, gene regulation events, and tissue specific and/or subcellular compartment-specific target enzyme information. Supplementary Figure 4 shows RNA-Seq counts observed in leaves and stems for each line investigated. In WT plants, the relative order of transcript abundance in stems (where lignin deposition is greatest) was determined to be ADT5 > ADT4 > ADT3 > ADT1 > ADT6 . Earlier phylogenetic evaluation showed that ADT3, ADT4 and ADT5 are all part of the same phylogenetic subgroup. It was also determined that these three ADTs correspond to proteins that exclusively utilize arogenate as a substrate ( Cho et al., 2007 ), whereas ADT1, ADT2, and ADT6 showed a preference for arogenate but could potentially, albeit less efficiently, use prephenate in synthesizing Phe. Our findings that ADT3 , ADT4 , and ADT5 were highest in abundance in 4 week old stems was corroborated by similar findings of RT-PCR levels found in 5 week old Arabidopsis stem tissues ( Corea et al., 2012c ) and separate Northern blot analyses ( Rippert et al., 2009 ) in 4 week old WT Arabidopsis . The latter showed that ADT4 and ADT5 were highest in abundance in stem and root tissues. RNA-Seq data also indicated an increase in ADT expression between ADT3 , ADT4 , and ADT5 , when one of the ADT s in that subgroup was knocked-out. Large increases of ADT5 were observed in the stems when ADT3 and ADT4 were knocked out, showing ∼2 fold and ∼4 fold increases in the adt3 and adt4 knockout lines, respectively. When ADT5 was knocked out, ADT4 was expressed in greater amounts (∼2 fold increase). Overall, these data showed that, especially in stem tissue, ADT mRNA expression between ADT3 , ADT4 , and ADT5 seemed to be coordinated, as remaining ADTs in the ADT3/ADT4/ADT5 subgroup increased when other subgroup members were knocked out. In leaf tissue, only modest effects were observed within this subgroup. To view coverage and relative amounts (i.e., counts) of mRNA fragments identified in each RNA-Seq analysis (in reference to each ADT in leaves or stems), location of the various T-DNA insertions used to produce the KOs and peptides identified from the proteomics analysis, gene product data for each gene were illustrated side by side. The IGV Browser ( Robinson et al., 2011 ; Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013 ) was used to map out reads to the gene, and using a PNNL developed script 9 , the peptide data were converted into BED files which could then be used by any genome viewer software. This allowed visualization of proteomics data in relation to the gene alongside the RNA-Seq data. Supplementary Figure 5 displays an example of gene-transcript-peptide visualization comparisons detected in WT and ADT KO lines for ADT5 . Comparisons of all other ADT s in all RNA-Seq and proteomics data can be accessed at the MassIVE and ProteomeXchange data repository sites (Accession numbers MSV000081518 and PXD007701 , respectively). Read sequences downstream of transcription from T-DNA insertions displayed vastly decreased levels as expected. The proteomics data also showed that few peptides from ADTs were identifiable in the high throughput analysis here, which indicated that the ADTs were likely low in abundance relative to the entire proteome in the leaves. By contrast, in stem tissues, more ADT transcripts and peptides were generally identifiable, supporting the hypothesis that ADT genes, as well as proteins, were relatively higher in abundance in stem tissues compared to leaves. This is likely due to stem tissues needing to biosynthesize lignin in greater relative amounts compared to leaves. We next examined what proportion of each KEGG functional category, on average, contained the most significantly ( p -value < 0.05) changed proteins and transcripts in both leaf and stem tissues in all ADT KO lines ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). Categories with the greatest proportion of significantly changed proteins/transcripts were involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, α-linolenic acid metabolism, nitrogen, carotenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as aromatic amino acid metabolism. These findings are in high agreement with the significant changes observed in the metabolomics data ( Supplementary Figures 2 , 3 ). Protein and transcript analyses of the putative carotenoid biosynthesis pathway showed a high degree of significantly changed ( p -value < 0.05) protein/transcript members ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) when ADT content was reduced. Metabolite measurements of putative carotenoids also showed an almost universal increase in abundance in all ADT KO lines in both leaves and stems ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). Carotenoids function in plants as accessory pigments in plastid membranes and in chloroplasts they are thought to contribute to energy dissipation and can act as protective agents against reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Nisar et al., 2015 ). Carotenoids and their cleavage apocarotenoid products, which may also serve as signaling molecules, are important in assembly of photosynthesis and antenna proteins for photosynthesis and photoprotection ( Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010 ). Protein analysis of photosynthesis and antenna protein biosynthesis pathways showed a relatively high proportion of significantly changed proteins ( p -value < 0.05) ( Supplementary Figure 6A ) in ADT KO mutants suggesting that knocking out ADTs in plants also affects photosynthesis. While increases in the proportion of significantly changed proteins were observed in photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways, especially in stems, such large changes were not seen at the corresponding transcript level. The fact that mRNA pools related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were not changed much, whereas translation copy numbers were largely increased, raises the possibility of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Other categories which were markedly different between protein and transcript data included those involved in Phe metabolism, and glycolate/decarboxylate metabolism. These were found to be highly changed in the protein data, especially in stem tissues, but less so at the transcript level. Categories that showed relatively high changes at the transcript level, but did not seem to translate to higher changes at the protein level, included those pathways involved in alanine/aspartate/glutamate, propanoate, and galactose metabolism, respectively. This was not surprising given that ADTs biosynthesize Phe. We also observed that shikimate-chorismate derived metabolism pathways (i.e., to Phe, Tyr, and tryptophan) were highly changed at both transcript and protein levels. It is known that Phe, Tyr, and Trp produced via the shikimate-chorismate pathway contribute to feedback inhibition mechanisms of various shikimate pathway enzymes upstream of ADT ( Tzin and Galili, 2010 ), and that ADT KOs can alter not only Phe levels but also levels of Tyr and Trp ( Corea et al., 2012a ). We thus hypothesize that in ADT KO mutants there likely may be alterations in the levels of other metabolites synthesized from Phe/Tyr/Trp precursors. These could potentially affect metabolites including phytohormones, which could, in turn, produce system-wide effects. For instance, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is synthesized from Trp, and IAA can affect changes in growth, development and metabolism ( Zhao, 2010 ). Another phytohormone potentially altered in ADT KO mutants may be jasmonic acid (JA). While we did not specifically detect JA or any other phytohormone in the untargeted metabolomics data, changes in JA precursors may be indicative of potential changes in the downstream phytohormone levels. JA is derived from α-linolenic acid ( Weber, 2002 ) and α-linolenic acid metabolism pathways were highly changed at both the transcript and protein level ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). α-Linolenic acid is not only a precursor to JA, but also aids in photosynthetic thylakoid membrane fluidity ( Yashroy, 1987 ) potentially acting as another contributor to alterations affecting photosynthesis. Other studies indicated that JA levels have a strong relationship to lignin levels. Denness et al. (2011) showed that both JA-isoleucine production and ROS production could form a negative feedback loop which can then repress each other’s production and influence lignin accumulation. Given there were lower levels of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate levels in the metabolomes derived from both leaf and stem tissue of ADT KO mutants compared with WT, it may be that ROS is higher in concentration in ADT KO mutants given that there is less ascorbate to scavenge ROS. This along with altered levels of JA could potentially be contributing signals affecting lignin biosynthesis. Ascorbate is also a cofactor for biosynthesis of several other phytohormones, such as ethylene, gibberellins, and abscisic acid ( Pastori et al., 2003 ). Due to the potential for all these various phytohormones to be altered in amounts when ADT is knocked out, we hypothesize this may be why we see multiple pathway enzymes and metabolite levels affected and not just those directly upstream or downstream of ADT . Integrated Metabolome, Proteome, and Transcriptome Analysis Figure 2A shows Pearson’s Pairwise log 2 abundance dataset correlations between each WT and ADT KO mutant, as compared to every other ADT KO mutant between both proteins and transcripts at the gene product (protein or transcript) and KEGG ortholog (KEGO) enzyme family levels. Transcripts and proteins had an average correlation of 0.394 and 0.369 in leaf and stem data, respectively. Correlations increased, however, when data were further collapsed into KEGO comparisons, with abundance correlations on average being 0.615 and 0.645. Only about 30 and 28% of the transcriptome was detected at the protein level in leaf and stem data ( Figure 2B ), respectively, whereas KEGO level coverage was about 65%. About 17% of proteins had no detectable transcript, and about 8% of protein KEGOs had no corresponding detectable transcript KEGOs. Overlap percentages between detectable transcripts and proteins also varied due to the KEGG functional category of which they were a member ( Figure 2C ). Proteins present which no longer have a detectable transcript might represent long-lasting proteins or protein degradation products remaining in the cells after degradation of the corresponding mRNA have occurred. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Proposed correlations of transcript and protein data. (A) Pearson pairwise correlation plots of each log 2 abundance ratio data between each ADT KO mutant versus WT dataset compared with all others in both the transcript and protein data. The two leftmost plots are from transcript and protein data, and the last two plots represent collapsed transcript and protein KEGG ortholog data (KEGO) for leaf or stem sample sets. (B) Venn diagram transcripts and proteins, and transcripts and protein KEGOs identified in leaf and stem data. (C) Transcript and protein overlap in all protein and transcript data according to KEGG functional category. To integrate transcript, protein and metabolomics data for a more direct comparison, KEGO values were compared. In this way, since protein and transcript values reflect an overall summed contribution to each enzymatic reactions, their comparisons are likely closer to metabolite abundance changes which themselves are tissue-wide summed values. Z -scores of each log 2 abundance ratio transcript-metabolite-protein reaction set are displayed in Figure 3 (leaf data) and Supplementary Figures 7 , 8 (stem data), respectively, with corresponding data in Supplementary Tables 2 , 3 . As shown in the transcript-metabolite-protein heatmaps, there are multiple enzyme KEGOs that can utilize the same substrate, but which could produce different metabolite products. Moreover, sometimes there are multiple KEGOs which carry out the same reaction. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Transcript-metabolite-protein heatmap displaying z -score comparisons of the log 2 ratio pairs ( ADT KO mutant/wild type, WT) of identified metabolites found to have a corresponding KEGG Ortholog Gene Family (KEGO) member which utilizes that specific metabolite as a substrate, and which were detected in both transcript and proteomics data. Each KEGO is displayed with substrate and product metabolite formed by that KEGO enzyme family. Data is further sorted into clusters that show: (A) Cluster 1 –Transcripts, metabolites and proteins which all on average increased or decreased in the ADT KO mutants together compared to WT. (B) Cluster 2 –Transcripts decreased, while metabolites and proteins in the ADT KO lines, on average, increased in abundance. (C) Cluster 3 –Transcripts and metabolites on average in the ADT KO lines increased, and proteins decreased in abundance compared to WT. (D) Cluster 4 –Transcripts and proteins decreased, and metabolites on average increased in the ADT KO mutants compared to WT. In each cluster, entries are further grouped by whether or not Metabolite 1 is a substrate or product in a unidirectional reaction or if it can be utilized in a reversible reaction. Reactions are then ordered from highest average metabolite z -score to lowest metabolite z -score. Red represents metabolites higher in abundance in the ADT KO mutant compared to WT, blue represents metabolites higher in abundance in WT compared to the ADT KO mutant, white represents metabolites unchanged in abundance between WT and the ADT KO mutant, and grey represents constituents not detected. Green squares indicate the highest average KEGO value associated with each detected metabolite. Grey circles represent KEGO reactions where there was only a single known reaction for that given substrate-product reaction. Blue circles represent log 2 transcript data that is most highly correlated to log 2 metabolite data across ADT KO mutants, i.e. if ratio abundances between transcripts and metabolites both showed profile increases across single, double, triple and quadruple ADT KO mutants, those would have a positive correlation regardless if the z -score values themselves were negative or positive. Orange circles represent log 2 protein data that are most highly correlated to log 2 metabolite data across ADT KO mutants, i.e. if ratio abundances between proteins and metabolites both showed profile increases across single, double, triple and quadruple ADT KO mutants, those would have a positive correlation regardless if the z -score values themselves were negative or positive.

We further clustered reactions into four groups: Cluster 1 ( Figure 3A , and Supplementary Figures 7A, 8A ) represent reactions which on average all increased or decreased in abundance in ADT KO mutants compared to WT samples for transcript, protein and metabolite data; Cluster 2 ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 7B, 8B ) depict KEGO reactions where metabolites and protein KEGOs either both increased or decreased together in abundance in ADT KO lines compared to WT, and where transcripts had an opposite abundance change to metabolites; Cluster 3 ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures 7C, 8C ) are of reactions where transcripts and metabolites either both increased or decreased together in abundance in ADT KO lines as compared to WT, and where proteins showed the opposite abundance change; and Cluster 4 ( Figure 3D and Supplementary Figures 7D, 8D ) are of KEGO reactions where protein and transcript abundance changes moved in an opposite direction to metabolite abundance changes between ADT KO mutant and WT lines. Alongside z -score values for each KEGO and metabolite, indicators were added to show the reaction that represented the most abundant KEGO for multiple KEGO reactions for a given metabolite. Indicators were also added for which KEGO abundances were most highly correlated to metabolite abundances. Additionally, KEGO reactions were further grouped into categories of whether or not the detected metabolite was either substrate or product in each reaction, or if it could be involved in a reversible reaction (i.e., a metabolite that can serve as both substrate and product). Figure 4 shows distribution of reaction types (unidirectional substrate to product, or reversible) and proportion of each reaction type with KEGOs most correlated to metabolite levels, and KEGOs of greatest abundance (when there are multiple KEGOs for a given metabolite). Interestingly, for the protein KEGO data, where a given reaction type showed highest proportion of the most abundant KEGOs, it then had the least proportion of highest correlations between protein and metabolite abundances ( Figures 4B,C ). When comparing protein KEGO and metabolite abundance changes, we also observed that the most highly abundant KEGOs were not usually the most correlated with detected metabolite level ( Figure 4 ), i.e., most abundant enzymes did not necessarily produce the most metabolite. Given that metabolite abundances are determined by multiple factors not represented by enzyme abundance alone (i.e., enzyme kinetics, differential degradation rates, and post-translational de/activation of enzymes), this observation is not surprising. Indeed, we can generalize that only ∼45–50% ( Figure 4D ) of the most abundant KEGOs produced metabolite levels that were most highly correlated to KEGO abundances. Metabolite levels controlled by other KEGOs, with low correlations to metabolite levels, may also be influenced by enzyme kinetics and post-translational activation/deactivation. Figure 4E showed that in Cluster 2 (i.e., transcripts are negatively correlated to proteins and metabolites) of the transcript-metabolite-protein comparisons, the most abundant KEGOs were present in both the leaves and stems. In contrast, Figure 4F had a negative correlation in both the leaves and stems, and in both transcript and protein data. Cluster 1 (i.e., transcript, proteins and metabolites are all positively correlated), and had the highest correlated KEGOs profiles to metabolite profiles. FIGURE 4.

Network Analysis Lignin levels were measured previously in the ADT KO mutant and WT lines by Corea et al. (2012c) A Spearman’s rank correlation between the ADT KO mutant and WT log 2 ratios to these lignin levels in 4 week old stems was thus calculated here, with proteins identified with a non-parametric measure of rank correlation (rho) of at least ±0.85. Proteins identified as having a high positive or negative correlation to varying lignin levels across ADT KO mutants were entered into the on-line network analysis tool STRING (see text footnote 7) ( Szklarczyk et al., 2017 ). Protein-protein interactions and associations identified from STRING were then used as input data into the network software Cytoscape ( Smoot et al., 2011 ). Z -score data representing abundance changes between ADT KO mutants and WT were overlaid on proteins (nodes), with line thicknesses (edges) of connecting proteins representing potential protein association strength as calculated by STRING analysis. Proteins found to be proximal in the initial Cytoscape network analyses were further manually grouped into KEGG functional categories to highlight relationships between functional categories. Supplementary Figure 9B shows a stem network analysis showing the z -score changes of multiple ADT KO mutant versus WT analyses. As more ADT s (and specifically as ADT3 , ADT4 , and ADT5 ) were knocked out and lignin levels decreased ( Supplementary Figure 9A ), protein abundances deviated further away from WT levels as indicated by nodes appearing darker red or blue in color ( Supplementary Figure 9B ). Figure 5A specifically shows the network analysis of adt3/4/5 stem data as compared to WT, with the ADT KO mutant having greatest reduction in lignin (cleavable monomeric G + S) levels as measured in 4 week old Arabidopsis stems ( Supplementary Figure 9A )–although the lignin level difference between adt3/4/5 and adt3/4/5/6 was not statistically different. Enzymes associated with aromatic amino acid, photosynthesis, carotenoid, and α-linolenic acid metabolism were found to be apparently correlated with reduced lignin levels, and this corroborated well with KEGG functional categories identified as being significantly changed ( Supplementary Figure 6A ). As our focus was in identifying potential lignin-associated proteins in post-transcriptional regulation, known and predicted interactions between mRNA processing and translation machinery proteins were highlighted (see Figure 5B ). Figure 5C displays the heat map of corresponding log 2 z -scores of transcript and protein data scrutinized from the mRNA processing and translation machinery for all 8 ADT KO lines ( Figure 5B ).

    "Conclusion": "To begin to put the analyses and discussion below in needed context, it is well known that transcripts and proteins are linked biologically by the central dogma which purports unidirectional flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to proteins ( Crick, 1958 ). Indeed, comparisons between proteomic and transcriptomic data can highlight which proteins and transcripts have a co-regulatory response (i.e., a high transcript level with a high protein level). The central dogma though is extended in this study to include metabolomics, as many metabolites represent the final product(s) biosynthesized by specific cells/tissues under various environmental conditions or through stresses at specific times during the lifespan of an organism. Protein and Transcript Comparisons In this study, it was found that transcript and protein data between ADT KO mutants correlated well within their own groups (i.e., transcript to transcript or protein to protein comparisons). However, correlations on average were quite low for transcript to protein comparisons, being better but still relatively low for transcript to protein KEGO/gene family comparisons. Venn diagrams which depict the overlap between proteins and transcripts revealed that (a) most transcripts detected did not correspond to a detectable protein, likely due to dynamic range and sampling limits of the proteomics technology compared to the depth of coverage capable with RNA-Seq and (b) not all proteins detected corresponded to a detectable transcript ( Figure 2 ) as could arise from differential mRNA and protein degradation rates. Lack of high correlations though between transcripts and proteins have been found to be typical. In many multi-omics evaluations, across eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, transcripts and proteins are only modestly correlated ( Foss et al., 2007 ; Ghazalpour et al., 2011 ; Battle et al., 2015 ; Chick et al., 2016 ; Hasin et al., 2017 ). Two examples from plant and animal organisms highlight this point. In a multi-omics investigation of maize, Walley et al. (2016) observed that transcriptome and proteome abundance profiles showed little overlap. In a comparable study of human disease, Hasin et al. (2017) found that transcript levels often exhibited a poor correlation with protein levels, although it was considered that the proteomics data alone was more proximal to the disease mechanisms. Furthermore, metabolite levels did not show a dominant correlation with either transcripts or proteins. These data illustrate the limitations in using only a single omics evaluation to make systems level biological assessments. Comparisons between these omics datasets may thus reveal (a) what transcripts are actually translated and in what copy number, and (b) what metabolomics data help reveal which proteins or protein families are more or less active in producing the observed metabolites. The integrated “omics” analysis, as presented here, provides over-arching and molecule specific information, which is useful for understanding general molecular pathway trends, and for identifying targets of interest for bioengineering purposes or for follow-on analyses. Network Analysis Reveals Lignin/Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Associated Proteins Network analysis is a powerful tool for understanding systems biology effects, drawing from known and predicted direct (physical) and indirect (functional) interactions from multiple data and literature sources. Such analyses can utilize enzyme relationships derived from hundreds of sources (e.g., yeast two hybrid, co-localization, co-expression, literature text mining, etc.). In turn, this can help provide new insights into interconnections and significant relationships of proteins with known and as-of-yet unknown function. Since our main focus was on proteins potentially related to altered lignin levels (as determined by thioacidolysis analysis), we selected those with greatest positive and negative correlative trends to lignin amounts present in Arabidopsis stems of each line. Centrally located in the lignin correlated protein network data created ( Figures 5A,B ) were eleven ribosomal subunits that correlated with reduced lignin levels. This raised the possibility that lignin levels may be in part regulated by a ribosome filter or “ribocode” ( Mauro and Edelman, 2002 ; Xue and Barna, 2012 ). That is, lignin biosynthesis regulation may be associated with presence of specific ribosomal subunits involved in translation of lignin-biosynthesis-associated mRNA. Recent studies have documented evidence for ribocodes, the concept of which suggests differential, temporal and spatial presence of specific ribosomal subunits which preferentially translate specific mRNAs, thus representing regulation at translation. Other observations of possible plant ribocodes include phosphate and Fe-deficiency studies by Rodríguez-Celma et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2013) , who both showed evidence for remodeled translational machinery in response to environmental signals in Arabidopsis . Liu et al. (2012) also reported that translational control was mRNA abundance independent, concluding that mRNA levels had less effect on gene activity than translational control mechanisms in Arabidopsis . Other potential targets of lignin biosynthesis regulation identified included those associated with purine metabolism, the spliceosome, RNA degradation, mRNA surveillance and general mRNA processing proteins. Post-translational modifications, protein transport, and targeting mechanisms also appeared correlated with varying lignin levels. Additionally, post-translational related protein processing involving the endoplasmic reticulum was identified, as well as ubiquitin proteolysis, phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, and phosphatase proteins which may be connected to important processes related to lignin biosynthesis. In our analysis as to what connects the spliceosome, which edits native mRNA into mature translatable mRNA and the ribosomal subunits, was the spliceosome protein DRH1 (At3g01540) to the large ribosomal subunit RPL2.1 (ATCG00830) ( Figure 5B ). DRH1 is a ATP/dATP-dependent RNA helicase and polynucleotide-dependent ATPase ( Okanami et al., 1998 ). Export of poly(A)(+) RNA has been shown to be greatly blocked in DRH1 mutants ( Du et al., 2016 ). Presence or absence of this helicase could thus serve as a level of regulation, blocking or allowing export of mRNA into the cytosol. Connected to the identified spliceosome proteins was SAP18 ( Song and Galbraith, 2006 ). In plants, this functions as a transcriptional repressor and associates with ethylene-responsive element binding factors to create a hormone-sensitive multimeric repressor complex under conditions of stress. A SAP18 loss of function mutant produces a plant both more susceptible to salt and impaired in chlorophyll synthesis. These data indicate what we generally observed with our multi-omics data, namely that: (a) despite any significant presence of mRNA, there are additional factors which may prevent proper processing of mRNA into mature translatable form; (b) there are also other factors which may prevent any mRNA present from ever leaving the nucleus to be translated. Together, these data also highlight the importance of proteomics to illuminate what protein products are actually present and which are potentially functional. Furthermore, the vast majority of lignin biosynthesis regulation research thus far has focused on genes and transcriptional control ( Nakano et al., 2015 ). From this body of knowledge, we know that lignin biosynthesis is influenced by a series of transcription factors, such as NAC master switches, which can activate or repress an array of other downstream transcription factors (e.g., MYBs). What is lesser known are what additional post-transcriptional controls of lignin or other phenylpropanoids exist. Due to our discovery that modulating ADTs produces differential lignin contents in Arabidopsis , the opportunity was presented where–through this multi-omics study–we could investigate molecular profiles with step-wise decreases or increases in lockstep to varying lignin levels. These results of our investigation suggest that there are potentially multiple processes, phytohormones and layers of regulation involved in lignin biosynthesis or in response to decreased carbon flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway. Since this study was focused on correlations specific to lignin deposition, most attention was paid to correlative levels found in stems, although other phenylpropanoid-derived biomolecules and other pathways were also affected by ADT composition changes in leaves. It may be an interesting and informative exercise to further explore correlative enzyme abundances to other phenylpropanoids that may play a more central role in leaf tissue function. For example, those associated with UV protection (e.g., flavonoids and sinapate esters) ( Stapleton and Walbot, 1994 ; Landry et al., 1995 ; Mazza et al., 2000 ; Clé et al., 2008 ; Sullivan et al., 2014 ), in order to tease out specific post-transcriptional biosynthesis regulation of formation of these other phenylpropanoids. Ultimately, the multi-omics investigation and network analysis presented here proved invaluable for understanding systems level changes that modulated ADTs evoke in a model vascular plant. Importantly, it highlighted potentially new levels of post-transcriptional regulation of lignin/phenylpropanoids that can provisionally serve as biomolecular targets for follow-on analyses and/or for bioengineering purposes, i.e., aimed at modulating or modeling lignin/phenylpropanoids in vascular plants. These proteins can thus be used in follow-on lignin-associated enzyme validation studies and/or can potentially serve as truly novel bioengineering targets for manipulation of lignin/phenylpropanoid levels in vascular plants. Potential of a Lignin Regulating “Ribocode” Ribosomes are the effectors in the final steps of gene expression, and it has emerged recently that ribosomes themselves could contribute to regulation via differential ribosomal subunit abundance. Evidence recently has also shown that according to developmental, environmental and pathological conditions, cells can produce different populations of ribosomes which differ in their ribosomal protein and RNA composition. These “specialized ribosomes” suggest that the unique ribosomal composition determines the translational activity of the ribosome and thus controls the biosynthesis of specific proteins and enzymes. For many years, ribosomes were thought to consist of a set number of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and rRNAs, with each RP present as a single copy with resulting conserved stoichiometry and homogeneity. One of the first indications that different types of ribosomes existed was from the study of RP paralogs in plants. In work done by Williams and Sussex (1995) , it was found that RPL16 paralog gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis were mutually exclusively expressed in different organs of the plant. In yeast studies, deletion of specific RP paralogs also gave rise to unique phenotypes ( Ni and Snyder, 2001 ; Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003 ). In human studies, evidence came from patients displaying genetic diseases (i.e., ribosomopathies) caused by haploinsufficiency of genes encoding key factors in ribosome biogenesis or RPs ( Draptchinskaia et al., 1999 ). Proteomic-driven analyses exploring composition of purified ribosomes under various conditions identified all RPs differentially expressed between conditions in murine embryonic stem cells, suggesting that different translational statuses were associated with differential stoichiometry among RPs ( Slavov et al., 2015 ). In our study, we used the STRING (see text footnote 7) algorithm to identify connections/associations between lignin profile correlated proteins. Our results returned interactions between nucleus and plastid proteins (e.g., RPL2.1 and DRH1). While there is currently no direct evidence in Arabidopsis that this association exists, there is growing documentation of interactions between homologs of these proteins in other organisms (e.g., humans, yeast, Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori ) ( Garcia-Gomez et al., 2011 ; Havugimana et al., 2012 ). Additional studies, however, would need to be performed to verify the actual association, if any, between eukaryotic and plastid translation-associated proteins in Arabidopsis . These studies indicating the influence of differential ribosomal subunit stoichiometry on differential phenotypes and/or translational products suggest that the ribosome has the ability to function in a regulatory fashion in translation. These supporting data, along with observations of correlative associations between specific ribosomes and lignin production in this study here, support the hypothesis that lignin levels in vascular plants may be partially controlled by specialized ribosome compositions or a lignin “ribocode.”",
