    "Abstract": "Abstract Excessive weight gain in adults is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes. Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. A baseline control group (n=7) was sacrificed at vector administration. rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (−4±2%) while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight (14±2%) during the study. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed 17% less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal white adipose tissue weight (−80%), serum leptin (−77%), and serum IGF1 (−34%). Cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, and in lumbar vertebra tended to be lower (p<0.1) in rAAV-GFP-treated rats (13.5-months-old) compared to baseline control rats (9-months-old). Significant differences in cancellous bone or biomarkers of bone turnover were not detected between rAAV-Leptin and rAAV-GFP rats. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone turnover.

    "Results": "The effects of hypothalamic rAAV-Leptin gene therapy on body weight, abdominal WAT weight, and food intake are shown in Figure 1 . rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (-4 ± 2%) during the 18 week duration of study; the estimated decrease in mean weight from weeks 0 to 18 was 8 ± 3 grams (p = 0.006; 95% CI: 2 grams, 13 grams). The weight loss in the rAAV-Leptin group occurred during the initial 4 weeks post-vector administration (estimated slope: −3.6, p < 0.0001; 95% CI: −5.2, −2.1) with weight increasing thereafter (estimated slope: 0.5, p = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.85) ( Figure 1A and B ). In contrast, control rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight (14 ± 2%) during the study; the estimated increase in mean weight from weeks 0 to 18 was 40 ± 2 grams (p = 0.006; 95% CI: 36, 45). The increase in weight was greater during the first 4 weeks following vector administration (estimated slope: 7.7, p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 6.4, 9.0) than during the subsequent 13 weeks (estimated slope: 0.7, p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.01). The rate of change in body weight (i.e., slope) differed between rAAV-GFP-treated and rAAV-Lep-treated rats during the first 4 weeks of treatment (p < 0.0001) but not during the subsequent 13 weeks. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed 17% less (53 ± 10 grams; p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 32 grams, 74 grams) than the rAAV-GFP-treated rats. This difference in body weight was associated with a pronounced reduction in abdominal WAT; WAT weight was 80% lower in rAAV-Leptin-treated compared to rAAV-GFP-treated rats ( Figure 1C ). Figure 1.

Food consumption was lower in rAAV-Leptin-treated rats compared to rAAV-GFP-treated rats ( Figure 1D ). Although significant differences in food intake were not detected between the two groups at 1 week post-vector administration, the estimated difference in mean food intake between the two groups during weeks 2 to 4 was 2.4 g/d (95% CI: 1.6, 3.3; p<0.0001); food intake averaged 17.1 g/d (95% CI: 16.2, 17.9) in the leptin group and 19.5 g/d (95% CI: 18.8, 20.2) in the GFP group (p<0.0001). For weeks 5 to 18, the difference in food intake was still significant (p=0.002), but the estimated difference dropped to 1.3 g/d (95% CI: 0.5, 2.1); food intake averaged 17.2 g/d (95% CI: 16.4, 17.9) in the leptin group and 18.5 g/d (95% CI: 17.86, 17.90) in the GFP group. Total food intake over the 18 week duration was 9% lower (p=0.071) in the rAAV-Leptin group compared to the rAAV-GFP group ( Figure 1E ). The effects of rAAV-Leptin gene therapy on leptin and NPY mRNA expression in hypothalamus and leptin and IGF1 mRNA expression in abdominal WAT are shown in Figure 2 . As expected, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats had higher hypothalamic leptin mRNA levels than rAAV-GFP-treated rats ( Figure 2A ). Significant differences in NPY mRNA expression in hypothalamus were not detected with treatment ( Figure 2B ). Significant differences were also not detected with treatment for leptin and IGF1 mRNA expression in abdominal WAT ( Figure 2C and D ). Figure 2.

The effects of rAAV-Leptin gene therapy on serum leptin, IGF1, growth hormone, glucose, adiponectin, CTx, and osteocalcin are shown in Figure 3 . Serum leptin and IGF1 concentrations were lower in rAAV-Leptin-treated rats compared to rAAV-GFP-treated rats ( Figure 3A and B ). Significant differences between rAAV-Leptin-treated and rAAV-GFP-treated rats were not detected for growth hormone ( Figure 3C ), glucose ( Figure 3D ), or adiponectin ( Figure 3E ). Furthermore, significant differences between the 2 treatment groups were not detected for CTx, a marker of bone resorption ( Figure 3F ) or osteocalcin, a marker of bone turnover ( Figure 3G ).

Significant differences in bone area were not detected between rAAV-Leptin-treated rats and baseline control rats. Significant differences in either BMC or BMD were not detected among baseline, rAAV-GFP, and rAAV-Leptin rats. Figure 4.

    "Conclusion": "The long-term effects of hypothalamic rAAV-Leptin gene therapy on energy balance and bone metabolism were evaluated in skeletally mature (9-month-old) female rats. Consistent with previous studies ( Boghossian et al. 2005 ), rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight during the 18 week duration of study. The respective changes in weight occurred during the first few weeks following vector administration, stabilizing thereafter. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal WAT weight, serum leptin, and serum IGF1. In contrast, rAAV-Leptin treatment had minimal long-term effects on bone mass, density, and architecture or serum markers of bone turnover. In the present study, the initial reduction in body weight following leptin gene therapy was associated with lower (−12.3%) energy intake compared to rAAV-GFP treatment. The initial increase in energy intake in rAAV-GFP-treated rats following vector administration likely represents a rebound in food consumption following a surgery-induced reduction in food intake. In support, historical data indicate that age-matched ad lib- fed rats consume ~18 g/d of diet ( Iwaniec, et al. 2011 ). In contrast, an attenuated rebound in food intake was apparent in rAAV-Leptin treated rats. Once weight stabilized at a lower level, energy intake continued to be lower (−7%) in the rAAV-Leptin-treated rats than in rAAV-GFP-treated rats. These findings are consistent with previous long-duration gene therapy studies ( Dhillon et al. 2001a ; Torto, et al. 2006 ). The regulatory actions of leptin to reduce energy intake are mediated through a hypothalamic relay involving activation of leptin receptors on orexigenic NPY and anorectic proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons ( Forbes, et al. 2001 ; Schwartz, et al. 1996b ). Morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are hyperphagic and express increased hypothalamic mRNA levels for NPY ( Schwartz, et al. 1996a ) and these abnormalities are reversed following leptin treatment ( Duan, et al. 2007 ). At study termination, hypothalamic leptin gene expression was elevated in the rAAV-Leptin gene therapy group but significant differences in hypothalamic NPY gene expression were not observed between treatment groups. It is possible, however, that reduced NPY expression was associated with initial weight loss following vector administration ( Bagnasco, et al. 2002 ; Beretta et al. 2002 ). Genetic obesity in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice is reversed following administration of leptin ( Levin, et al. 1996 ). In contrast, normal rats and mice exhibit age-related weight gain in spite of increased leptin levels. The failure of increased serum leptin to prevent further weight gain is generally attributed to blood brain barrier leptin resistance and/or hypothalamic leptin resistance ( Banks, et al. 1999 ; Banks, et al. 1996 ; Bluher and Mantzoros 2004 ; Bray 2004 ; Burguera, et al. 2000 ; Frederich, et al. 1995 ; Sahu 2002 ; Van Heek, et al. 1997 ). Gene therapy bypasses blood brain barrier leptin resistance by direct introduction of leptin into the hypothalamus. The present study demonstrates the long-term efficacy of this approach in inducing weight loss and maintaining lower body weight in skeletally mature female rats. Factors such as diet composition and physical activity may impact the efficacy of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy in preventing excessive weight gain ( Dube et al. 2002 ; Dube, et al. 2008 ; Shapiro et al. 2008 ). Nevertheless, our findings in rats consuming normal diet suggest that increasing hypothalamic leptin levels overcomes leptin resistance to prevent adult-onset weight gain. The elevated leptin mRNA levels that we detected in the hypothalamus 18 weeks following administration of rAAV-Leptin contrast with the notable reduction in serum leptin. The 77% reduction in serum leptin observed in the present study was associated with a similar decrease (−80%) in abdominal WAT weight. This finding is consistent with the concept that leptin levels reflect fat stores ( Hickey, et al. 1996 ). It is notable that the magnitude of lowering WAT weight (−80%) following rAAV-Leptin treatment greatly exceeded lowering body weight (−17%). This is consistent with previous reports indicating that rAAV-Leptin treatment preferentially reduces adipose tissue while preserving lean tissue ( Dhillon, et al. 2001b ). Furthermore, leptin administration has been shown to increase muscle mass in leptin–deficient ob/ob mice ( Bartell, et al. 2011 ) and aged C57BL6 mice ( Hamrick, et al. 2010 ). rAAV-Leptin treatment lowered serum IGF1 levels. IGF1 is an important mediator of the anabolic actions of growth hormone. A primary target of growth hormone is the liver, where the hormone stimulates IGF1 secretion through the activation of the hepatic growth hormone receptor. In turn, IGF1 modifies growth hormone secretion through a negative-feedback loop ( Clemmons 2007 ). Increased IGF1 levels and decreased growth hormone secretion are associated with obesity ( Garten, et al. 2012 ), whereas decreased IGF1 levels are associated with caloric restriction ( Mitterberger, et al. 2011 ; Rasmussen, et al. 1995 ). Thus, the observed decrease in serum IGF1 could reflect an increase in growth hormone secretion. However, we did not detect a change in growth hormone levels with treatment, a finding consistent with the lack of an effect of caloric restriction on growth hormone levels reported in obese subjects in some human studies ( Mitterberger et al. 2011 ; Rasmussen et al. 1995 ). A substantial proportion of serum IGF1 is nonhepatic in origin ( Liu, et al. 2000 ). Adipocytes produce IGF1 ( D’Esposito, et al. 2012 ), potentially contributing to reduced growth hormone secretion associated with obesity. Leptin gene therapy did not impact IGF1 mRNA levels in WAT but the dramatic decrease in WAT following gene therapy may have contributed to the reduction in serum levels of this growth factor. The decrease in serum IGF1 following rAAV-Leptin administration in normal rats contrasts with the response of ob/ob mice to leptin. Whereas, acute intravenously administered leptin had no effect on serum IGF1 ( Burcelin, et al. 1999 ), chronic intracerebroventricular leptin administration to ob/ob mice was reported to increase serum IGF1 levels ( Bartell et al. 2011 ). The latter long-term response may be related to normalization of growth hormone secretion in ob/ob mice ( Luque, et al. 2007 ; Sinha, et al. 1975 ). Elevated blood leptin is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetic kidney disease and several cancers ( Cheung, et al. 2010 ; Cleary, et al. 2010 ; Hoda, et al. 2012 ; Hou and Luo 2011 ; Nishimura, et al. 2012 ) and high serum IGF1 levels are associated with increased cancer risk ( Chaves and Saif 2011 ; Cleary, et al. 2009 ; Ribeiro, et al. 2004 ). Thus, reduction in serum leptin and IGF1, in addition to weight loss, may be a positive side effect of increasing hypothalamic leptin ( Lee, et al. 2010a ; Moore, et al. 2008 ; Olivo-Marston, et al. 2009 ; Wu, et al. 2010 ). Leptin increases bone nodule formation in vitro ( Gordeladze, et al. 2002 ) and increases bone formation when delivered to ob/ob mice by either intermittent subcutaneous administration ( Turner et al. 2013b ) or intracerebroventricular infusion ( Bartell et al. 2011 ). Furthermore, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increases osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and serum osteocalcin, and normalizes bone architecture in ob/ob mice without increasing serum leptin ( Turner et al. 2013b ). Although ob/ob mice have reduced osteoblast number and activity, the effects of leptin deficiency on bone metabolism appear to be partially compensated for by factors related to development of morbid obesity. Specifically, normalizing weight gain in ob/ob mice by dietary restriction and thermoneutral housing accentuated their skeletal phenotype ( Turner et al. 2014 ), characterized by reduced bone growth and turnover, low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In contrast to the notable effects of leptin to increase bone formation in leptin-deficient mice, increased leptin levels associated with moderate weight gain had no effect on bone metabolism in skeletally mature rats ( Turner and Iwaniec 2010 ). Similarly, prevention of weight gain in skeletally mature rats by mild caloric restriction had no negative impact on bone formation ( Turner and Iwaniec 2010 ). In the present long-term study, reduced serum leptin induced by hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was not associated with altered serum markers of bone turnover or accelerated age-related bone loss. Taken together, these findings suggest that the bone anabolic effects of leptin are most pronounced at low serum concentrations of the hormone and as a consequence hyperleptinemia does not confer additional positive skeletal benefits. Bone mass in growing rodents is tightly coupled to body size ( Iwaniec, et al. 2009 ). Cessation of linear bone growth occurs in rats as a consequence of formation of bone bridges that penetrate the growth plate, rendering further growth unfeasible ( Martin, et al. 2003 ). The time table for linear growth cessation varies among bones but growth generally ceases in female Sprague Dawley rats by 8 months of age. As in adult humans, periosteal bone formation continues in long bones of skeletally mature rats at a very slow rate throughout life ( Briot, et al. 2010 ; Stathopoulos, et al. 2011 ). Weight typically increases in rodents following skeletal maturity but the impact of weight changes on the skeleton has not been thoroughly explored ( Iwaniec and Turner 2013 ). In the present study, bone area measured by DXA and cortical bone volume measured by μCT exhibited an upward trend in rAAV-GFP rats whereas these parameters remained at baseline control levels in rAAV-Leptin rats. The strong association between bone size and body weight typically observed in WT mice are preserved in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice ( Iwaniec et al. 2009 ), a finding suggesting that increased bone size in aging rAAV-GFP rats is due to their increased body weight. As expected, age-related cortical bone loss was not observed in the present study. In humans, a negative intracortical bone remodeling balance contributes to age-related bone loss ( Seeman 2013 ). A limitation of rodents is that they do not exhibit intracortical bone remodeling. As a consequence, age-related cortical bone loss is limited to resorption occurring on the endocortical bone surface. Bone loss associated with aging at this site is slow and compensated for by addition of bone onto the periosteal surface ( Turner, et al. 2013a ). As in adult humans, cancellous bone remodeling continues throughout adult life in skeletally mature rats ( Iwaniec and Turner 2013 ). An imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption is responsible for persistent bone loss during aging in both species. The trend for age-related cancellous bone loss observed in femur and lumbar vertebra in the present study is consistent with previous results where significant bone loss is noted between 8 months and 2 years of age ( Turner et al. 2013a ; Turner, et al. 2001 ). Caloric restriction accelerates age-related cancellous bone loss ( Bodnar, et al. 2012 ; Mardon, et al. 2008a ; Mardon, et al. 2008b ), a finding consistent with the hypothesis that a decrease in leptin levels in the context of low energy availability contributes to bone loss. Leptin treatment, in spite of drastically reducing body weight in growing ob/ob mice, results in increased longitudinal bone growth, increased bone formation, increased bone resorption, a net increase in bone mass and normalization of bone microarchitecture ( Bartell et al. 2011 ; Hamrick, et al. 2005 ; Iwaniec, et al. 2007 ; Turner et al. 2013b ). In summary, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy, in spite of inducing weight loss, had minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture or biochemical markers of bone turnover. The lack of an effect of rAAV-Leptin gene therapy on bone in skeletally mature rats contrasts with the negative skeletal effects associated with similar weight loss induced by caloric restriction ( Turner and Iwaniec 2011 ). There has been remarkable recent progress in gene therapy, including treatment of diseases of the CNS ( Kantor, et al. 2014 ; Leone, et al. 2012 ). Our findings suggest that interventions, including hypothalamic leptin gene therapy, targeted toward increasing hypothalamic leptin levels have the potential to overcome leptin resistance and lower body weight without negatively impacting the skeleton.",
