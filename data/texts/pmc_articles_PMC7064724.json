    "Abstract": "Abstract The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation. Keywords: spaceflight, root, skewing, transcriptomics, abiotic stress, acclimation, physiological adaptation",
    "Results": "APEX-03 seedling growth in occurred in the Veggie hardware on the ISS ( Figure 1A ). Veggie is housed in the Columbus module ( Figure 1A , left), and for the APEX-03 experiment, configured to accommodate racks of 10 cm Petri plates ( Figure 1A , middle). Images of plant growth and morphology were recorded by astronaut Butch Wilmore just prior to harvest ( Figures 1A , right, B ). Col-0 and WS can display distinct patterns of root growth in response to environmental stimuli. In terrestrial environments, changing the angle of the growth surface can create ecotype-specific patterns of skewing ( Rutherford and Masson, 1996 ; Schultz et al., 2017 ). In a microgravity environment with a gradient light source to impart a tropic cue, skewing patterns of WS and Col-0 recapitulate the patterns seen on terrestrial angled growth surfaces ( Paul et al., 2012a ). However, in a microgravity environment with uniform, non-directional lighting such as provided by the Veggie hardware in the current experiment, root growth patterns are more disorganized ( Figure 1B ). Nonetheless, skewing trends can still be discerned by following the angles of growth as the roots develop, and these are quantified in Figure 2A for Col-0 and spr1 , and in Figure 2B for WS and sku5 . In all representations and discussions of skewing, the direction indicated is from the perspective of being viewed from behind the growth medium. FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Quantification of APEX-03-2 Root Growth. Images acquired at the time of harvest of spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) plants were used for measurements. Primary root length measurements for (A) Col-0 and spr1 and (B) WS and sku5 were taken using Jfilament and analyzed in R. Significant differences between genotypes ( spr1 vs. Col-0, sku5 vs. WS) and growth conditions (FLT vs. GC) were assessed via two-tailed t -tests and are indicated by asterisks above bars connecting the relevant sets of measurements (Bonferroni correction: ∗ p < 0.0125; ∗∗ p < 0.001). The 8d Col-0 FLT vs. GC comparison did not meet this cutoff ( p = 0.0151). Error bars show the SEM of each set of measurements. (C) The angle measured between the root tip and the initial direction of root growth in the 4-day-old seedlings. Plots are separated into rows by growth condition, and into columns by genotype. Positive and negative angles represent rightward and leftward growth of roots, respectively, when viewed from behind the media. Angles are binned in 10° intervals, with each bar’s length representing the number of roots within that bin. As such, a bar reaching the second ring of each plot represents ten roots within that bin. However, note that the upper limit of bin size is lowered in the spaceflight plots to accommodate the higher variation in these data. The total number of roots represented in each plot is indicated in its bottom-right corner, and the mean angle of each plot is noted in its bottom-left corner. FLT, spaceflight; GC, ground control. Col-0 and Spr1 Germination and Morphology of spr1 in Spaceflight Phenotypic differences among the Col-0 background plants in GC and spaceflight (FLT) environments were primarily limited to skewing angles in the roots ( Figures 2 , 3 ). There were no statistically significant differences in the primary root length between GC and FLT in either Col-0 or spr1 4d or 8d plants. Although Col-0 root length appeared to be reduced in spaceflight in 8d plants, the p- value did not quite meet the requirements for significance (two-tailed t -test, p = 0.0152, whereas cut-off was p < 0.0150) ( Figure 2A ). There were differences in root length between Col-0 and spr1 genotypes in the GC ( p = 1.48 E-9) but FLT Col-0 and FLT spr1 roots were not statistically different. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab High resolution images of the Col-0 and spr1 growth patterns. Images are arranged such that the ground control seedlings (A–D) are in the left column while spaceflight seedlings are on the right (E–H) . Vertically, images alternate between Col-0 (A,C,E,G) and spr1 (B,D,F,H) . The images taken at the 4 day time point (A,B,E,F) are grouped above those taken at the 8 day time point (C,D,G,H) . Images taken from above the growth medium at the time of harvest. Grid squares are 13 mm wide. Both 4d and 8d GC Col-0 seedlings grew with very little left or right deviation down the vertical face of the plate medium, while the GC spr1 mutant plants of both ages showed distinct skewing to the left ( Figures 2C , 3A–D ). The 4d FLT Col-0 plants generally skewed slightly to the left with some variation ( Figures 2C , 3E ). In contrast, the roots of the 4d FLT spr1 plants demonstrated an increased severity of skewing, which was manifested as a strong left-hand curved growth pattern ( Figures 2C , 3E,F ) that was significantly different between GC and FLT (two-tailed t -test, p = 0.00385). For both genotypes the variance in the growth angle (as noted in the SD values in Figure 2 ) was greater in the spaceflight samples. After 8d of growth, the increased skewing in FLT spr1 led to associations with other roots, in contrast to FLT Col-0 which tended to spread more evenly across the plate ( Figures 3G,H ). There were no differences between GC and FLT the germination rates of either Col-0 or spr1 . The 4d harvest images ( Figures 3A,B,E,F ) were used to compare seedlings with any ungerminated seeds; germination in both genotypes was 100% under both GC and FLT conditions ( Supplementary Table S2 ). The spr1 Spaceflight Response Involved Fewer Transcriptomic Changes Than Col-0 Spaceflight-conditioned differential gene expression patterns were highly dependent upon the genotype, ecotype, and developmental age of seedlings. Quantitative gene expression data revealed patterns from three perspectives: spaceflight versus GCs for each genotype at each developmental age ( Figure 4A : FLT vs. GC), wild type plants versus the mutant genotype in each environment and age ( Figure 4B : spr1 vs. Col-0) and between the two developmental ages ( Figure 4C : 4d vs. 8d). The numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were categorized according to the magnitude of their fold-change values in the Col-0 and spr1 roots. In the FLT vs. GC comparison ( Figure 4A ), both lines differentially expressed fewer genes at the 8d timepoint than at 4d in all fold-change categories. The spaceflight acclimation of spr1 also required fewer genes than Col-0 to be differentially expressed. In the direct comparison of spr1 with Col-0 ( Figure 4B ), more DEGs were observed within each growth condition at 4d than at 8d. The difference in total DEG count between conditions was also reduced at 8d. This occurred in almost all fold-change categories, and differences in total DEGs between the lines diminished between timepoints irrespective of the growth condition. In the developmental comparison of expression between the 4d and 8d timepoints ( Figure 4C ), the roots from the FLT context showed lower counts of total DEGs than their respective GC roots. However, while spr1 required slightly fewer genes to be differentially expressed during development in the GC context, the opposite was true in FLT, where spr1 required more DEGs for spaceflight development than Col-0. Twofold-change categories that did not follow these trends were those of the DEGs upregulated and downregulated more than twofold across spr1 and Col-0 development, respectively, which were larger in FLT than in GC. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Col-0 and spr1 overall differential gene expression levels. A graphic representation of the genes differentially expressed in the (A) FLT vs. GC, (B) 4d vs. 8d, and (C) spr1 vs. Col-0 comparisons. Upregulation of a gene denotes a higher expression level in the first context of the comparison. Genes are separated into categories based on direction of differential expression and a Log 2 (Fold-Change) magnitude cut-off of one. d, day; DEG, differentially expressed gene; Downreg, downregulated; FLT, spaceflight; GC, ground control; Mag, magnitude; Upreg, upregulated. Data are based on four biological replicates. The relative contributions of DEGs with high degrees of differential expression (greater than twofold change) in response to spaceflight were variable among genotypes and developmental age. In the FLT vs. GC comparison ( Figure 4A ), the proportion of these DEGs was elevated in spr1 (4d: 41.8%, 8d: 22.0%) relative to Col-0 (4d: 17.8%, 8d: 12.5%), and the difference in this proportion between the lines declined over time. However, when the genotypic comparison of s pr1 vs. Col-0 ( Figure 4B ) was made, the proportion of these DEGs showed the opposite trend. In this case, the level of differential expression was slightly higher in FLT at 4d (GC: 16.5%, FLT: 23.9%) and at 8d the proportion of these DEGs was elevated in GC (GC: 30.2%, FLT: 11.9%). In the developmental comparison ( Figure 4C ), the primary point of interest was the low number of genes whose expression increased to a high degree over time in Col-0 GC roots (33 DEGs) when compared to the other contexts. In the same time frame, spr1 increased expression of 424 genes over twofold to accomplish the same development. spr1 Differentially Expressed Defense Pathways in Its Spaceflight Response Most of the genes that are highly differentially expressed between the Col-0 and spr1 are unique within the context of developmental age or growth environment ( Figure 5A ). However, a small number were differentially expressed between genotype irrespective of environment or age ( Figure 5A ). The coordinately expressed upregulated genes were related to the regulation of defense responses (NIMIN-1, ALD1, DLO1). The only genes that registered as coordinately downregulated in this comparison were SPIRAL1 and an antisense transcript (AT3G29644) of a transposable element which did not show differential expression itself.

In this case, upregulation of a gene indicates a higher expression level in spr1 than in Col-0.

The significance of the GO terms’ enrichment is represented by the –Log 10 transform of its q -value. The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates. The theme of stress response and defense was also evident in the GO enrichment analyses of the genes differentially expressed between Col-0 and spr1 in the spaceflight environment. The significantly over- and underrepresented GO terms among biological processes are indicated in Figure 5B . Genes associated with general stress responses and environmental stimuli were prominent, as well as those annotated to terms related to defense responses. DEGs associated with these defense and stress pathways have been noted in the FLT vs. GC comparisons of previous studies (e.g., Correll et al., 2013 ; Paul et al., 2013 , 2017 ; Choi et al., 2019 ). Genes involved in responses to salicylic acid, a phytohormone linked to both plant defense signaling and regulation of plant development ( Klessig et al., 2018 ), were also enriched. Carbon fixation pathways, and specifically multiple ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCo) genes, were also upregulated in 4d FLT spr1 ( Figures 5B,C ). Genes encoding proteins localized to the apoplast were also enriched among those upregulated in FLT spr1 , indicating that significant remodeling of processes within the cell was also needed by spr1 within the spaceflight environment ( Figure 5C ). Many of the DEGs associated with the acclimation to spaceflight were unique to genotype and to the developmental age of the plants ( Figure 6A ). There were 554 genes differentially expressed by at least twofold between spaceflight and ground among the two age groups (4d and 8d) of the two genotypes (Col-0 and spr1 ), with 63 genes coordinately expressed across all plants. Developmental age had a substantial impact on the spaceflight response of both genotypes; in both Col-0 and spr1, the 4d plants had a higher number of DEGs than the 8d plants. There was a large amount of overlap between the GO processes identified from the DEGs used to acclimate to the FLT condition for spr1 and Col-0 ( Figure 6B ). Among the more widely shared GO categories in the 4d plants of both genotypes were those corresponding to the regulation of gene expression and transcriptional processes. These were more highly enriched in spr1 roots than in Col-0, however, it can also be seen that there is a spr1 -specific enrichment of the same terms among those genes which are downregulated in the response to FLT. The term for a response to karrikin compounds (phytohormone-like molecules derived from burning plant material) was also indicated. Many light signaling terms also appeared as enriched among DEGs downregulated in FLT, and these were involved with the response to various wavelengths of light as well as the response to elevated light intensity. However, specific photosynthetic terms appeared amongst those which were downregulated only at 8d in Col-0. Similar localization terms appeared specifically in 8d Col-0 as well ( Figure 6C ), indicating that these were changes in the expression of genes directly involved in the photosynthetic machinery. While both spr1 and Col-0 4d were enriched with DEGs localized to the apoplast, these were among the upregulated genes in spr1 and the downregulated genes in Col-0, alongside other terms related to extracellular structures. Furthermore, terms related to organellar localization were significantly underrepresented in those genes upregulated in Col-0 at 4d. FIGURE 6.

In this case, upregulation of a gene indicates a higher expression level in FLT than the GC. (B,C) Gene ontology (GO) terms for (B) biological processes and (C) cellular compartments whose annotated genes were over- and underrepresented in the lists of DEGs for each context which met the twofold cutoff. The significance of the GO terms’ enrichment is represented by the –Log 10 transform of its q -value. The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates. The expression of genes associated with the developmental age was impacted by the spaceflight environment ( Figure 7A ). Approximately 26% of the total DEGs meeting the criteria for inclusion were required to be differentially expressed at some level regardless of the growth condition or genotypic background to facilitate development. However, among only those DEGs which met the twofold change cutoff, there were not GO terms shared so ubiquitously between contexts ( Figure 7B ). While broad GO terms for gene expression and metabolic processes were underrepresented in many of the contexts, more specific terms related to developmental and metabolic regulation were enriched during development in Col-0. Genes related to oxidative stress were also enriched among those genes more highly expressed at 4d in FLT in both genotypes. Localization GO term enrichments were highly divided between intracellular and extracellular compartments, which were consistently underrepresented and overrepresented, respectively ( Figure 7C ). These underrepresented GO terms occur mostly within the sets of DEGs which were upregulated between 4d and 8d, with many more significantly enriched in spr1 . The primary exception to this was a set of terms related to the chloroplast and the RuBisCo complex, which were mostly enriched in those DEGs more highly expressed in early development of spr1 .

WS and Sku5 Germination and Morphology of sku5 in Spaceflight Phenotypic differences among the WS background plants in GC and FLT environments included root length and skewing angles ( Figures 2 , 8 ). The primary root lengths of FLT WS were decreased significantly compared to GC at 8d (two-tailed t- test, p = 0.000209), but not at 4d. There were no differences in root lengths between GC and FLT sku5 plants of either 4d or 8d plants ( Figures 2B , 8C,D,G,H ). There were differences in root length between WS and sku5 genotypes in the GC ( p = 0.0013) but FLT WS and FLT sku5 roots were not statistically different ( Figures 2B , 8C,D,G,H ). FIGURE 8. Open in a new tab High resolution images of the WS and sku5 growth patterns. Images are arranged such that the ground control seedlings (A–D) are in the left column while spaceflight seedlings are on the right (E–H) . Vertically, images alternate between WS (A,C,E,G) and sku5 (B,D,F,H) . The images taken at the 4d time point (A,B,E,F) are above those taken at the 8d time point (C,D,G,H) . Images taken from above the growth medium at the time of harvest. Grid squares are 13 mm wide. There were no statistically significant differences in the overall change from vertical between WS and sku5 in either GC or FLT environments ( Figures 2C , 8A–D ). The differences in root angles between GC and FLT for each genotype, and between the WS and sku5 genotypes in both FLT and GC environments, also failed to meet statistical criteria. However, visual inspection of the images, and also the plots of Figure 2C , illustrate the difference in the directional trends for root growth in each genotype and environment. For both genotypes the variance in the growth angle (as noted in the SD values in Figure 2 ) was greater in the spaceflight samples. The FLT sku5 seeds germinated at a significantly reduced rate (48%) compared to WS FLT (85%), and to sku5 GC (77%) and WS GC (93%) [χ 2 (3, N = 185) = 15.01, p = 0.00181] ( Supplementary Table S2 and Figures 8A,B,E,F ). However, the FLT sku5 seeds that germinated produced plants that were comparable to their GC counterparts, as evidenced both by plate images and by the lack of difference in root length between FLT and GC sku5 at 4 and 8d ( Figures 2B , 8B,D,F,H ). The Expression of More Genes Is Altered in sku5 Than in WS During Spaceflight The trends of differential expression in WS and the sku5 line contrasted with those seen in Col-0 and spr1 in that WS and sku5 show an elevated transcriptomic response to spaceflight over time, with sku5 further differentially expressing more genes than WS ( Figure 9 ). The clearest example of this was the FLT vs. GC comparison of gene expression for these lines, where the number of DEGs required for spaceflight acclimation of sku5 were fivefold and twofold more than WS at 4d and 8d, respectively ( Figure 9A : FLT vs. GC). However, both genotypes increase in their DEG counts between 4d and 8d. The proportion of DEGs with a greater than twofold change also decreased to a very similar degree for both WS (4d: 63.2%, 8d: 14.5%) and sku5 (4d: 62.8%, 8d: 14.2%) despite the large difference in counts. When the genotypes were compared directly, the transcriptomic differences between them were exacerbated as they acclimated to the flight condition over time ( Figure 9B : sku5 vs. WS). The proportion of DEGs meeting the twofold change criteria followed a similar trend to that seen in flight acclimation, where it decreased in both GC (4d: 40.9%, 8d: 13.0%) and FLT (4d: 52.8%, 8d: 9.3%). Despite these trends, most genes among the FLT 4d DEGs that had greater than twofold change were those that were expressed more highly in sku5 . This trend persisted into the 4d vs. 8d comparison ( Figure 9C : 4d vs. 8d), where sku5 in the FLT condition required more genes to be differentially expressed in order to develop. S ku5 in the GC condition behaved much like WS in both FLT and GC conditions in terms of DEG counts in each fold-change category. Together, these patterns of gene expression indicated that the conditions of spaceflight had a disproportionate effect on the sku5 roots’ transcriptomic responses, but that each genotype’s response to spaceflight over time involved a greater number of DEGs of lower fold-changes. FIGURE 9. Open in a new tab WS and sku5 overall differential gene expression levels.

Genes are separated into categories based on direction of differential expression and a Log2(Fold-Change) magnitude cut-off of one. d, day; DEG, differentially expressed gene; Downreg, downregulated; FLT, spaceflight; GC, ground control; Mag, magnitude; Upreg, upregulated. Data are based on four biological replicates. Sku5 Highly Induced ABA- and Stress-Associated Genes in Spaceflight The genes differentially expressed between sku5 and WS were similar between GC and FLT growth conditions ( Figure 10A ), in that the same genes that were highly upregulated in WS GC were highly upregulated in FLT for sku5 . Among these were many late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) family proteins, whose expression has been connected to enhanced resistance to abiotic stresses and alterations in ABA sensitivity ( Zhao et al., 2011 ; Candat et al., 2014 ). Additional LEA family genes and seed storage proteins, such as CRUCIFERINA (CRA1) and CRUCIFERIN 3 (CRA3) were seen as upregulated uniquely in sku5 FLT. Alongside these were further genes associated with ABA- or ABA-independent dormancy signaling, notably REDUCED DORMANCY 5 (RDO5), DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1), and HIGHLY ABA-INDUCED PROTEIN 2 and 3 (HAI2, HAI3). In 4d sku5 spaceflight plants, genes encoding LEAs and other seed-associated proteins are among the most highly induced (Log 2 [5 to 10], or 30 to 1000-fold). Many of these patterns are further supported by GO biological process term enrichments ( Figure 10B ), where almost all of the overrepresented terms are enriched within the group of genes more highly expressed by sku5 roots at 4d in FLT. Outside of the mentioned ABA signaling and seed development genes, terms for regulation of seed dormancy and negative regulation of post-embryonic development are overrepresented, alongside more general terms such as responses to temperature and stress. All of the significant GO localization enrichments were for genes more highly expressed in WS in the 4d FLT context, involving either DEGs related to the RuBisCo complex or extracellular structures ( Figure 10C ). DEGs encoding proteins anchored to the PM are enriched for this group, indicating an important role for them in WS. FIGURE 10. Open in a new tab sku5 vs. WS; the effects of SKU5 loss on gene expression. (A) Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the sku5 mutant and its WS wild-type background with greater than twofold magnitude in at least one context. DEG heatmaps are scaled such that yellow and blue represent more extreme levels of up- and downregulation, respectively, while red and green represent lower fold-changes in the same manner. In this case, upregulation of a gene indicates a higher expression level in sku5 than in WS. (B,C) Gene ontology (GO) terms for (B) biological processes and (C) cellular compartments whose annotated genes were over- and underrepresented in the lists of DEGs for each context which met the twofold cutoff. The significance of the GO terms’ enrichment is represented by the –Log 10 transform of its q -value. The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates. Many of the LEAs and ABA-responsive DEGs in the sku5 vs. WS comparison were also highly upregulated by sku5 in the FLT vs. GC comparison, and some were unique to the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 ( Figures 10A , 11A ). The majority of FLT vs. GC DEGs (70.3%) were only detected in one of the sku5 FLT vs. GC comparison contexts. As such, the majority of the GO biological process terms found to be enriched were unique to the DEGs upregulated in FLT sku5 at the 4d time point ( Figure 11B ). Hormone response and signal transduction terms were enriched, with ethylene signaling, ROS response, and light signaling among the more specific pathways to be represented. In tandem, these 4d sku5 roots had decreased enrichment of DEGs associated with the synthesis of suberin. Uniquely to this comparison, 8d FLT WS roots upregulated genes related to chromatin remodeling. As seen in other comparisons ( Figures 6C , 7C , 10C ), WS upregulated genes annotated to the RuBisCo complex in FLT ( Figure 11C ). Additionally, the 8d downregulated DEGs for WS were overrepresented for extracellular localization, and DEGs whose products localized to intracellular and organellar compartments were underrepresented ( Figure 11C ). However, sku5 showed overrepresentation of downregulated DEGs annotated to the extracellular region at the earlier time point of 4d. FIGURE 11.

The significance of the GO terms’ enrichment is represented by the –Log 10 transform of its q -value. The scaling scheme used for the GO term heatmaps was similar to that described for DEGs, where yellow and red denote overrepresented terms, and blue and green denote underrepresented terms. Data are based on four biological replicates. Late embryogenesis abundant family genes were also prominently represented in the 4d vs. 8d comparison within GC and FLT environments ( Figure 12A ). Examination of the GO biological process terms yielded by the individual lists of DEGs showed many similar stress response terms, but these were primarily in the context of genes more highly expressed at the 4d time point ( Figure 12B ). However, based on the level of significance of the terms, the enrichment of DEGs related to many of these stress responses was enhanced in FLT. In the cases of oxidative stress and cold response sku5 showed this enhancement. However, in some cases, such as the response to desiccation, both genotypes showed a lack of significant term enrichment in FLT. The sku5 roots also showed slightly higher significance of enrichment of DEGs associated with responses to water deprivation and light stimuli in early FLT development, compared to WS. GO terms related to cell wall remodeling and immune responses, commonly seen in FLT acclimation, were also enhanced in their enrichment during FLT development of sku5 compared to GC development. The remainder of the significant GO terms were unique to one context, and among these is the response to karrikin, which was previously seen in the context of spr1 and Col-0 FLT vs. GC comparisons ( Figure 6B ). Of the terms enriched specifically in sku5 FLT development, processes involved with salt and ROS stress, as well as light responses, were significantly higher at 4d. At 8d, the terms associated with sku5 in FLT were primarily focused on cell wall remodeling and biosynthetic processes. FIGURE 12.

    "Conclusion": "The discovery that root skewing was not gravity-dependent, and prevalent in both light-grown and dark-grown plants in spaceflight habitats ( Millar et al., 2011 ; Paul et al., 2012a ; Nakashima et al., 2014 ), invited questions about the underlying mechanisms of this behavior in the microgravity environment and the relationship between those mechanisms and physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The experiments described here examined the contribution of two well-characterized skewing genes that are in two different ecotypic backgrounds and which affect different skewing control pathways. SPIRAL1 plays a role in directional cell expansion by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics ( Furutani et al., 2000 ; Nakajima et al., 2004 ; Sedbrook et al., 2004 ; Galva et al., 2014 ). SKU5 is a skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall and plasma membrane protein, which has also been implicated in stress response signaling ( Sedbrook et al., 2002 ). The sku5 and spr1 mutants are well characterized in terrestrial environments, skewing rightward and leftward, respectively, when grown vertically ( Furutani et al., 2000 ; Sedbrook et al., 2002 , 2004 ; Nakajima et al., 2004 ). The experimental readouts used to assess the physiological adjustment of seedlings to spaceflight were root and germination measurements, and the differences in transcriptomic responses among the genotypes. The opposing directions of the skewing phenotypes of the mutant lines are believed to stem from alterations of distinct cellular processes, and this is most clearly evidenced by the differential effects of microtubule-destabilizing agents on these mutants ( Furutani et al., 2000 ; Sedbrook et al., 2002 , 2004 ; Nakajima et al., 2004 ; Galva et al., 2014 ). The distinct roles of these two genes in determining root directionality is supported by their different individual responses to spaceflight in the present experiments. The data from sku5 and spiral1 are analyzed in context with their parent genotype, WS and Col-0 respectively, as WS shows a much smaller number of spaceflight differentially expressed genes than Col-0 ( Paul et al., 2017 , and Figures 4 , 12 ). Spr1 Skews Leftward on Earth and Moreso in Space Terrestrial studies concluded that SPR1 reinforces rightward root growth by affecting the balance of thigmotropism and gravitropism ( Galva et al., 2014 ). Morphological data from APEX-03-2 support this notion. At the 4d time point, spr1 seedlings showed a consistent leftward skewing phenotype on Earth, and the leftward skewing was substantially enhanced by spaceflight ( Figures 2C , 3B,F ). However, spr1 and Col-0 roots were the same length in spaceflight, indicating that the role of SPR1 lies in directionality rather than overall root length in spaceflight ( Figure 2A ). These data suggest that in the absence of gravitropism during spaceflight, thigmotropism plays a dominant role in growth directionality and that SPR1 acts to positively enhance skewing while not affecting root length in spaceflight. The spaceflight effect of spr1 lies in morphology management rather than growth management. SPR1 binds with another microtubule plus-end tracking protein, EB1b ( Galva et al., 2014 ). It has been postulated that EB1b and SPR1 work in concert to regulate mechanical force-based directional growth with a balance of gravitropism and thigmotropism, where SPR1 participates in the reinforcement of rightward growth through thigmotropic processes, while EB1b negatively regulates thigmotropism and positively regulates gravitropism ( Galva et al., 2014 ). In an environment lacking a gravity cue such as spaceflight, this gravitropic reinforcement has no effect, resulting in the enhanced skewing of spr1. Similarly elevated leftward skewing of spr1 occurs under cold conditions alongside alterations of the microtubule network, and skewing is conversely suppressed by heat or salt treatments ( Furutani et al., 2000 ; Sedbrook et al., 2004 ). The elevated skewing seen in spr1 may therefore be the result of spaceflight-induced signals in the root which are similar to those involved in cold response signaling. The microtubule-associated protein MAP65-1 is more abundant in spaceflight, and is also hypothesized to be linked to cold-responsive microtubule stabilization ( Chen et al., 2016 ; Soga et al., 2018 ). Actin cytoskeleton mutants also exhibit a greater degree of skewing in microgravity when compared to wild-type and GC plants, though this skewing occurs to the right when regarded from behind the media ( Nakashima et al., 2014 ). These structural systems both appear to have roles in suppressing endogenous root skewing patterns in spaceflight. The spaceflight-enhanced skewing of spr1 may therefore be attributed to its altered microtubule dynamics in the spaceflight response, similar to altered dynamics induced by terrestrial cold stress. Sku5 Skews Inappropriately in Spaceflight The sku5 mutant did not show an enhancement of skewing in spaceflight as compared to the GC, nor did sku5 respond to the spaceflight environment in the same manner as it does to terrestrial disruption of the gravity vector ( Figure 2C ) ( Sedbrook et al., 2002 ). However, sku5 and WS roots were the same length in spaceflight, indicating that the role of SKU5 also lies in directionality rather than overall root length in spaceflight ( Figure 2B ). These data suggest that SKU5, like SPR1, regulates morphology and directionality rather than growth. However, SKU5 regulation is very different from SPR1 regulation of skewing morphology in that lack of SKU5 function prevents appropriate skewing in spaceflight. This prevention of skewing, the sku5 interruption of the pathways involved in skewing, leads to dramatic changes in differential expression of genes for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Differential Gene Expression as a Measure of the Quantity and Character of the Physiological Adaptation to Spaceflight Differential gene expression profiles reveal the underlying gene expression changes needed for physiological adaptation to environmental changes. There are numerous, well-documented environmentally-induced gene expression profiles in plants, all of which detail specific physiological changes related to the specific stresses. The intensity of the differential gene expression response, in terms of the number of genes involved and their fold-change levels, may be considered a measure of the metabolic cost of adapting to that environment. A terrestrial example of this metabolic cost is in the transcriptomic response to cold stress in Arabidopsis lines that are either sensitive or resistant to cold ( Chan et al., 2016 ). Plants that overexpressed RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 4 (RDM4) had a cold-tolerant phenotype, and exhibited a greatly reduced transcriptomic response to cold stress compared to the more cold-sensitive wild-type and rdm4 knock-out plants ( Chan et al., 2016 ). The plants that were least able to tolerate cold environments displayed a far higher number (up to 100×) of differentially expressed genes in response to cold than the cold-tolerant plants exposed to the same environment ( Chan et al., 2016 ). Spr1 adapts to spaceflight with far fewer DEGs than Col-0. This suggests that mutation of the SPR1 skewing pathway enhances spaceflight physiological adaptation. In contrast, the sku5 mutation results in a doubling of DEGs in response to spaceflight, and many of those DEGs are members of strong environmental stress responses. This strong response suggests that the SKU5 pathway plays a key role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. Sku5 Mutation Produces a Dramatic Increase in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight Sku5 showed a dramatic program of differential gene expression compared to the GCs, a program that was more pronounced and diverse than that of spr1 . Many of the genes that are significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and GCs are associated with skewing and cell wall remodeling, irrespective of intensity of skewing phenotype in the spaceflight-grown plants ( Figure 13 ). FIGURE 13. Open in a new tab Differentially expressed genes between FLT and GC of particular interest. Statistically significant DEGs with greater than twofold magnitude in at least one context. Each gene in this list corresponded to the following categories: potential and highly probable skew gene candidates (Skewing, HPSGC; Schultz et al., 2017 ), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA; Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008 ), associated with gravitropism (GO Terms; Carbon et al., 2008 ), and abscisic acid (ABA, GO Terms; Carbon et al., 2008 ). The heat map scale Log 2 (Fold-Change) is indicated in the bottom right corner. Categorical information is provided beside each gene group. Data are based on four biological replicates. One of the unique aspects of the sku5 spaceflight differential gene expression program involved genes usually associated with dehydration and ABA signaling. The FLT sku5 expression patterns of LEAs and other ABA-associated genes suggest a spaceflight adaptation phenomenon involving, but not limited to, an altered ABA sensitivity in these plants. Many of the highest magnitude DEGs in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 were in the LEA family, primarily dehydrins and group-4 LEAs; many of these genes were induced by greater than 30-fold [Log 2 (5)] ( Figure 13 ). LEAs are responsive to ABA signaling resulting from osmotic, cold, and drought stresses and act to enhance stress resistance through membrane stabilization, sequestration of ROS, and prevention of protein aggregation ( Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008 ; Zhao et al., 2011 ; Candat et al., 2014 ; Fang and Xiong, 2015 ; Suzuki et al., 2016 ). Many of the DEGs and LEAs upregulated in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 are associated with embryonic programs that are adjusted at the chromatin level during germination in response to environmental factors ( Tai et al., 2005 ; Tang et al., 2012 ; Molitor et al., 2014 ). DOG1, for example, increases in expression in cold temperatures, acting to repress germination during those unfavorable conditions ( Footitt et al., 2013 , 2014 ). The sku5 DEGs HAI2 and HAI3 are involved in regulating ABA signaling and responding to soil water potential ( Bhaskara et al., 2012 ; Kim et al., 2013 ). REDUCED DORMANCY 5 also acts to inhibit germination, but functions independently of DOG1 and ABA signaling pathways ( Xiang et al., 2014 ). The GO term enrichments for sku5 also support this, as DEGs associated with dormancy regulation are overrepresented in the dataset ( Figures 10B , 12B ). It is important to note that SKU5 is expressed in floral tissue ( Sedbrook et al., 2002 ). This altered ABA signaling in sku5 could therefore be attributed to downstream effects of altered seed development. In support of these interpretations, germination rates were repressed in FLT sku5 ( Figures 8F,H ) relative to GC sku5 ( Figures 8B,D ), and to FLT WS ( Figures 8E,G ), as evidenced by counts of ungerminated seeds in the harvest images ( Supplementary Table S2 ). While spr1 is also expressed in reproductive tissues, the differential expression of dormancy signaling genes was not prevalent in the Col-0 and spr1 comparisons ( Nakajima et al., 2004 ; Sedbrook et al., 2004 ). In fact, those few DEGs related to ABA signaling observed in Col-0 and spr1 displayed a trend in expression that was opposite of what was seen in FLT sku5 . As a prime example, the LEA ABA-RESPONSE PROTEIN (ABR) was only slightly downregulated in the spaceflight acclimation of 8d spr1 . ABA-related dormancy signaling may be affected by the spaceflight environment. Differential expression patterns also indicate that sku5 mutants experience changes in the plasma membrane during spaceflight. Alterations in plasma membrane dynamics and composition occur in plant responses to terrestrial stressors (e.g., cold stress) and in the response of Chlorella vulgaris to spaceflight ( Popova et al., 1989 ; Solanke and Sharma, 2008 ; Kazemi-Shahandashti and Maali-Amiri, 2018 ). Roots of Pisum sativum grown under clinorotation also show shifts in membrane composition in sterol-enriched membrane domains known as “lipid rafts” ( Kordyum et al., 2018 ). Membrane-bound GPI-APs, such as SKU5, localize to these lipid raft nanodomains and are important to stress acclimation, including spaceflight-associated stress ( Minami et al., 2008 ; Mazars et al., 2014 ; Ferl et al., 2015 ; Takahashi et al., 2016 , 2019 ; Yeats et al., 2018 ). ABA signaling proteins also localize to these membrane domains in a sterol-dependent manner ( Demir et al., 2013 ). Given that sku5 shows alterations of ABA signaling pathways in spaceflight ( Figure 13 ), it can be hypothesized that the lack of SKU5 may affect the function of these nanodomain-localized ABA signaling processes under stress conditions. The expression of a chloroplastic aldehyde reductase, ChlADR (AT1G54870), involved in the detoxification of reactive carbonyls formed as a result of lipid peroxidation, and TSPO, which participates in mobilization of lipids, are induced by stress and highly induced in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 ( Guillaumot et al., 2009 ; Yamauchi et al., 2011 ; Jurkiewicz et al., 2018 ). These patterns match the gene expression trends of the spaceflight-induced LEA family genes that are thought to directly participate in membrane stabilization under stress ( Battaglia et al., 2008 ; Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008 ; Candat et al., 2014 ). The gene expression patterns of these ABA-responsive genes in sku5 suggest that SKU5 affects ABA signaling in response to stresses. Furthermore, this shows that pathways affecting membrane stabilization and remodeling are required for the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 that are not essential for its growth in terrestrial environments. SKU5 may also directly participate in stress response signaling or cellular remodeling due to its localization to the outer aspects of the plasma membrane. A SKU5 homolog is highly upregulated [Log 2 (14)] in tobacco overexpressing a FATTY ACID DESATURASE 3 (CbFAD3-OE) homolog derived from the cryophyte Chorispora bungeana when compared to a wild-type line in the response to salt stress ( Shi et al., 2018 ). CbFAD3-OE lines exhibited enhanced membrane fluidity and survival under cold, salt, and drought stresses, and demonstrated reduced lipid peroxidation and membrane leakage via activation of calcium signaling and suppression of ROS ( Shi et al., 2018 ). As such, the sku5 line may require alternative pathways to be activated to maintain membrane fluidity and integrity during spaceflight acclimation due to the removal of SKU5 from this response pathway. The transcriptomic response of sku5 to the spaceflight condition was elevated compared to WS, which would support the activation of additional pathways ( Figures 10A , 11A ). ROS-related genes are abundant in spaceflight transcriptomes, and reflect a response to spaceflight that is conserved among Arabidopsis cultivars and related species ( Paul et al., 2013 , 2017 ; Sugimoto et al., 2014 ; Ferl et al., 2015 ; Sng et al., 2018 ; Choi et al., 2019 ; Zhou et al., 2019 ). Our findings were consistent with this trend across genotypes and the skewing mutants based on GO term enrichments associated with the spaceflight response ( Figures 6B , 11B ). Notably, sku5 FLT showed elevated expression of genes required to be expressed in response to ROS at the 4d when compared to FLT WS ( Figures 9B , 10B ), supporting this hypothesized function of SKU5 in this membrane-associated ROS suppression. While FAD3 was not among the sku5 FLT DEGs, FLORAL TRANSITION AT THE MERISTEM1 (FTM1), which catalyzes the desaturation of stearic acid to oleic acid upstream of FAD3, was upregulated in WS and spr1 spaceflight acclimation, and downregulated in that of Col-0 and sku5. FTM1 participates alongside FAD3 in the mediation of stresses associated with Arabidopsis crown gall development through their enrichment with C18:3 fatty acids ( Klinkenberg et al., 2014 ). The increase of C18:3 class of fatty acids also correlated with the enhanced membrane stability measures in the CbFAD3-OE lines ( Shi et al., 2018 ). These results therefore suggest a role for SKU5 in stress metabolism with respect to the plasma membrane, a role that was not revealed in previous ground experiments. An additional explanation for the altered spaceflight response of sku5 comes from its likely association with auxin metabolism and signaling upstream of the plant TOR complex. A SKU5 homolog in maize encodes an interactor of AUXIN-BINDNG PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) ( Shimomura, 2006 ). The abp1 mutant demonstrates a leftward-skewing phenotype opposite to that seen in sku5 ( Sedbrook et al., 2002 ; Gao et al., 2015 ). Auxin gradients are still present in spaceflight root tips despite the lack of a gravity cue in the spaceflight environment ( Ferl and Paul, 2016 ). The presence of SKU5 acting to mediate anisotropic cell growth in response to endogenous auxin gradients could facilitate the spaceflight acclimation of wild-type seedlings. GO terms associated with the DEGs of 4d spaceflight response of sku5 suggested this connection as well, with many alterations occurring in signaling pathways related to ethylene, ROS, and light signaling ( Figure 11B ). Furthermore, ABP1 is associated with the activation of TOR and the promotion of growth through the action of an auxin-activated signaling pathway mediated by the RHO OF PLANTS 2 (ROP2) GTPase ( Xu et al., 2014 ; Schepetilnikov et al., 2017 ; Ryabova et al., 2019 ). The TOR complex integrates diverse environmental signals to regulate growth, and ABA signaling inhibits TOR, promoting autophagy to allow for stress tolerance acquisition ( Ryabova et al., 2019 ; Signorelli et al., 2019 ). SKU5 may impact this mechanism indirectly through affecting the action of ABP1, and a reduction of the auxin signaling into TOR would shift the balance in favor of stronger ABA responses, such as that seen in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 . A ROP6 pathway also mediated by ABP1 affects the activity of KATANIN, which severs cortical microtubules to facilitate reorganization of the microtubule network in response to environmental stimuli ( Chen et al., 2016 ). As a result, the spr1 mutant may be faster to form a spaceflight-tolerant microtubule network due to its altered microtubule kinetics, while the sku5 mutant may not be able to perform this function as rapidly due to altered ABP1 signaling. Spr1 Mutation Produces a Decrease in Differential Gene Expression in Spaceflight The spaceflight DEGs of spr1 and Col-0 were primarily in the defense and salicylic acid-mediated signaling related to cell wall remodeling ( Figures 5B , 6B ). Genes related to these cell wall pathways are common in spaceflight transcriptomes ( Paul et al., 2012b , 2013 , 2017 ; Correll et al., 2013 ; Kwon et al., 2015 ; Johnson et al., 2017 ). While plants grown in microgravity may be more susceptible to pathogenic infection ( Leach et al., 2001 ; Ryba-White et al., 2001 ), the fact that all examples to date of upregulated pathogen response genes are from plants grown in sterile conditions suggests that these genes are serving other purposes of cell wall remodeling in spaceflight ( Paul et al., 2012b , 2013 , 2017 ; Correll et al., 2013 ; Choi et al., 2019 ). ALD1 is a positive regulator of salicylic acid accumulation pathways through the generation of metabolites ( Nie et al., 2011 ; Cecchini et al., 2015 ). NIMIN1 and DLO1 contribute to opposing processes, acting to repress immune responses at the level of expression regulation ( Kohler et al., 2002 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ; Zeilmaker et al., 2015 ). Salicylic acid induces the lipid raft-localized pathways induced by ABA, in order to promote cellular uptake of water ( Demir et al., 2013 ; Prodhan et al., 2018 ). The upregulation of salicylic acid signaling in spr1 may act through these pathways, promoting abiotic stress response through pathways normally associated with defense responses ( Figures 5B , 6B ). This hypothesis might also explain why the induction of “defense” and wound response pathways occurs in spaceflight in the absence of pathogenic infections ( Nejat and Mantri, 2017 ). The recently characterized ORBITALLY MANIFESTED GENE 1, a regulator of ROS signaling that is both flg22- and wound-inducible, provides a spaceflight-relevant example ( Sng et al., 2018 ). Considering that wounding and pathogen invasion also mechanically disrupt membranes and cell walls ( Chen et al., 2016 ), these pathways may be signaling remodeling of cellular structures and the microtubule network in spaceflight. Flg22 application to Arabidopsis cell cultures and induction of MAMP-triggered immunity also has the effect of redistributing flavonoid compounds from biosynthetic processes important to oxidative stress response processes to the production of compounds important to defense ( Schenke et al., 2019 ). Genes associated with the production of phenylpropanoids are less-represented among the spr1 DEGs downregulated in spaceflight compared to Col-0, although they are also more highly represented among spr1 DEGs downregulated across development in spaceflight ( Figures 6B , 7B ). As such, these DEGs negatively regulating defense signaling in spr1 may contribute to an enhanced ability to mediate ROS generated in spaceflight through the redistribution of limited resources early in its development. This conclusion is also supported by the gene categories enriched in the spaceflight acclimations of Col-0 and spr1 , where DEGs associated with responses to oxidative stress are more enriched among genes upregulated in FLT in spr1 than in Col-0 ( Figure 6B ). Many abiotic stresses trigger remodeling of cortical microtubules, with salt stress tolerance requiring the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SPR1 ( Shoji et al., 2006 ; Wang et al., 2011 ; Chen et al., 2016 ). Microtubule reorientation also contributes to cell elongation in the spaceflight response of hypocotyls ( Soga et al., 2018 ). The spr1 mutant, which has altered microtubule dynamics in favor of decreased stability, may have enhanced capabilities for remodeling of microtubule networks in the response to many forms of environmental stress ( Galva et al., 2014 ). Spr1 and Sku5 Mutants Both Differentially Regulate Skewing-Associated Genes in Response to Spaceflight Despite the many differing spaceflight responses of spr1 and sku5 , DEGs identified as likely to be associated with the integrative signaling of skewing ( Schultz et al., 2017 ) were among those differentially expressed in both mutants in spaceflight ( Figure 13 ). Two of the highly likely skewing genes, SENESCENCE 1 (SEN1) and ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 1 (ASN1) are induced in spaceflight ( Figure 13 ). The SKU5 protein is endocytosed through different pathways within the root tip dependent on local auxin signals and perceived stress conditions ( Baral et al., 2015 ). SKU5 could act to modulate growth regulation through its aforementioned association with the ABP1 apoplastic signaling pathway upstream of TOR, and both SKU5 and SPR1 can affect microtubule reorganizing pathways. This would enable SKU5 to impact the spaceflight response via the regulation of meristematic competence and cell cycle progression, processes that are affected in spaceflight ( Matía et al., 2010 ), clinorotation, RPM exposure, and magnetic levitation ( Herranz and Medina, 2014 ; Herranz et al., 2014 ; Boucheron-Dubuisson et al., 2016 ). This is supported by the M-phase peak of SKU5 expression and its previously hypothesized role in regulating the cell cycle ( Menges et al., 2002 ; Sedbrook et al., 2002 ). However, the importance of senescence in the context of root skewing has not been well-studied. The recent association of strigolactone-independent karrikin-sensing pathways with skewing provides a potential direction for study ( Swarbreck et al., 2019 ). The loss of the protein MORE AXILLARY BRANCHES 2 (MAX2), which also participates in strigolactone-associated senescence signaling, exacerbates the skewing phenotype of sku5 in a sku5 max2 line ( Ueda and Kusaba, 2015 ; Swarbreck et al., 2019 ). Therefore, these results reinforce connections between environmental and senescence signaling and root skewing. The association of skewing-associated genes with these regulatory networks provide a means by which the mutation of these genes can alter the response to the spaceflight condition.",
