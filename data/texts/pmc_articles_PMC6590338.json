    "Abstract": "This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by Aspergillus nidulans , Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus niger , and Aspergillus terreus in the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, is discussed in depth.",
    "Results": "",
    "Conclusion": "In the post-genomic era, fungal sequencing initiatives have accelerated our ability to link SMs to their biosynthetic gene clusters. Further, they have enhanced our understanding of fungal SM biosynthetic processes and the underpinning genes that define them. Such knowledge can have enormous applications for pharmaceutical production and industrial processes, as genetic engineering can be used to optimize SM production levels or to generate useful second-generation analogs. Despite the significant progress made in the past six years, many SMs that Aspergillus species have the capacity to produce still have not been identified or linked to their biosynthetic gene clusters, which remains true for many other fungal species. Thorough characterization of the Aspergillus secondary metabolome will require a combination of approaches, including the use of inducible promoters, overexpression of pathway-specific regulators, growth in various conditions, heterologous expression, and gene knockout techniques, along with the collaborative effort of the research community.",
