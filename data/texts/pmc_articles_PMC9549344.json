    "Abstract": "In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two ...",
    "Results": "To examine the nature of the IK regions of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG in greater detail, we used JPred to predict secondary structure [ 30 ]. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2 , and in Fig. 1B , there are only short stretches of α-helix (15, 9, 9, 11, 7 and 7 amino acids, from N- to C-terminus of IK), and even fewer and shorter instances of β-strands (3, 2, 3, 4 and 6 amino acids). Except for the 15-residue long region near the IK N-terminus, all the other instances of α-helices reside in the C-terminal one third of the IK sequence. These α-helices reside within the C-terminal 232 residues which is the minimal binding site determined for LIM-9 (FHL2) [ 9 ], and thus may comprise an unrecognized or novel domain. Thus, the remaining sequence of UNC-89 IK, approximately, 475 residues, is random coil. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2 and Fig. 1B , obscurin and SPEG have even fewer predicted secondary structure elements, although like UNC-89, obscurin has a fairly long α-helix of 19 residues lying within the C-terminal 52 residues. Given the nature of the amino acid sequence of the IK region of UNC-89, we wished to determine how it might respond to a mechanical pulling force using the single molecule force spectroscopy technique. To carry this out, we first expressed in E. coli 1 571 residue segment comprising the majority of the 645 residue interkinase region (IK) flanked on the N- and C-terminus by two copies of Ig27 from human titin. The response of Ig27 to pulling force is well documented and served as an internal control. In addition, the protein had a 6XHis tag at its N-terminus ( Fig. 2A ). After purification ( Fig. 2B ), the protein was allowed to attach to a glass surface coated with Ni 2+ -NTA to allow binding of the N-terminus of this polyprotein via its 6XHis tag. The stylus of the single-molecule force spectrometer was allowed to bind non-specifically and at random points along the polyprotein, and then pulling force was applied by moving the piezo-electric platform downward. A representative force curve of the mechanical unfolding of the polyprotein in which the stylus had attached to the C-terminus is shown in Fig. 2C . After a long and featureless trace without energy barriers, the typical unwinding of the 4 Ig domains is found. The statistical distribution of the contour length of the long featureless peak ( Fig. 2D ) shows that the mean contour is approximately 185 nm. This is a good match to the expected contour length of a fully unwound polypeptide of 571 amino acids, since the average length of an amino acid is 0.34 nm, i.e. 0.34 nm/aa × 571 aa = 194 nm. Based on this force curve and contour length, we can conclude that the IK has the mechanical properties of a random coil and behaves like an entropic spring. Fig. 2.

We wished to determine the in vivo consequences of removing the IK from UNC-89. To do this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create an in-frame deletion of the same 571 residues that we explored with the single molecule method in vitro. However, to be able to monitor the expression of UNC-89 large isoforms in which the IK had been deleted we added an HA tag to the N-terminus of the large isoforms. We thought such tagged UNC-89 could also be used in future immunoprecipitation experiments to identify proteins in a complex with UNC-89. Animals expressing HA-UNC-89 large isoforms were obtained by CRISPR/Cas9, and the strain is designated unc-89(syb797) . The proper fusion of a tag containing three consecutive HA sequences to the normal N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by Sanger sequencing ( Supplemental Figure 3 ). The presence of the HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by western blot ( Fig. 3A ). Moreover, the HA-UNC-89 proteins could be detected by confocal microscopy to be normally localized to the sarcomeric M-lines of body wall muscle ( Fig. 3B ). The HA tag also does not affect the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres as assessed by confocal microscopy using phalloidin for I-bands, or antibodies to myosin heavy chain A for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, UNC-95 for the bases of M-lines and dense bodies, or ATN-1 (α-actinin) for the major portion of dense bodies ( Fig. 4 ). As shown later, this HA tag also does not affect whole animal locomotion. However, HA tag does reduce the abundance of the UNC-89 giant isoforms (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 ). With an n=2, the level of expression from unc-89(syb797) is 51.2% (standard deviation of 11%) of the level from wild type. Fig. 3. Addition of HA tags at the N-termini of the largest UNC-89 isoforms does not affect the normal M-line localization of UNC-89 in body wall muscle sarcomeres, but does moderately reduce the level of UNC-89 giant isoforms in whole animal extracts.

Scale bar, 10 μm. Next, we used unc-89(syb797) as starting point to make an in-frame deletion of 571 residues of the IK by CRISPR/Cas9, and this strain is designated unc-89(syb797 syb1257) . A schematic of the genomic region deleted is shown in Fig. 5a . Sanger sequencing was used to verify that the 4,614 bp genomic deletion resulted in an in-frame deletion of the unc-89 coding sequence ( Supplemental Figure 4 ). Before characterizing either unc-89(syb797) or unc-89(syb797syb1257) strains further, each was outcrossed 5X to wild type, to remove most possible off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. As shown in Fig. 5B , the in-frame deletion of IK (in syb797syb1257 ), leads to expression of UNC-89 giant isoforms that can be detected with either antibodies to the N-terminal HA tag or our standard antibodies raised against epitopes in the middle of UNC-89. We had hoped to be able to use an antibody to PK2 to prove that the deletion is in-frame, however, two attempts to make such an antibody (in rabbits or rats) failed. Nevertheless, since the levels of large isoforms did not diminish below that shown with the HA tag (in syb797 ), it is likely that we achieved an in-frame deletion which does not destabilize the protein. We expected to observe slightly smaller giant isoforms from syb797syb1257 compared to wild type, but there seems to be no discernible difference ( Fig. 5B ). Although there are at least 14 predicted giant isoforms ranging from 5,000 to 8,081 residues each, we do not know the relative abundance of each of these giant isoforms. Deletion of 571 residues out of a total of 8,081 residues for the largest isoform would be only a decrease of 7% and may not be a difference detectable by the gel system used. However, as shown in Fig. 5C , the internal deletion of the IK of UNC-89 results in disorganization of M-lines in body wall muscle. This can be seen when either an established monoclonal for UNC-89, MH42, or anti-HA is used in immunostaining. In fact, the signals from each antibody overlap. To assess the in vivo consequences of removing the IK, we examined the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres in greater detail, and measured whole animal locomotion and force generation. To assess sarcomere organization of the IK deletion, we took the same strategy as we did to characterize the sarcomere organization of unc-89(syb797) : immunolocalization of several proteins with known sarcomere locations using confocal microscopy. Deletion of IK (in mutant syb797syb1257 ) results in disorganization of sarcomeres in all substructures ( Fig. 6 ). It is important to note however that in syb797syb1257 , although the pattern of UNC-89 is disorganized (i.e. not parallel straight lines as in syb797 or wild type), UNC-89 is still detectable at high levels consistent with the western blot result. Note also that in syb797syb1257 , the disorganization of UNC-89 appears quite similar to the pattern of disorganization of myosin heavy chain A (MHC A). This is not unexpected as thick filaments in nematode body wall muscle have differential localization of two myosin heavy chain isoforms, with MHC A in the middle, and MHC B in the major outer portions [ 31 ]. Normally thick filaments are arranged parallel and in register, so that the M-line is the structure in the middle of the A-band, which contains MHC A, and where the thick filaments are crosslinked. Thus, when imaging C. elegans body wall muscle with light microscopy, the localization of MHC A and UNC-89 are nearly identical [ 4 , 32 ]. Note that upon anti-UNC-95 staining, the bases of M-lines are often branched and can overlap the bases of dense bodies ( Fig. 6 , right inset). Overall, these results indicate that the IK is required for the proper organization of sarcomeres. Fig. 6. unc-89(syb797 syb1257) animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region have disorganized myofibrils. Open in a new tab Each panel shows representative confocal images of several body wall muscle cells stained with antibodies to the indicated sarcomeric components or with rhodamine-phalloidin. Scale bar, 10 μm. We examined the organization of MHC A and UNC-89, proxies for the middle of A-bands, at higher resolution using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). In Fig. 7 A and B , it is clear that the N-terminal HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms (in syb797 ) has no effect on the normal pattern of straight parallel A-bands. However, in-frame deletion of IK (in syb797syb1257 ), for both MHC A and UNC-89 immunostaining, it is evident that the A-bands are broken, and much of the parallel arrangement is missing. In addition, there appear to be extra, short A-bands (indicated by arrows in Fig. 7 ) that lie in the spaces between otherwise nearly normal A-bands. By capturing optical sections with an interval of 0.2 μm, we noticed that these partial A-bands lie mostly close to the outer cell membrane of the muscle cells. From top to bottom of Fig. 7A and B , images are shown from close to the outer muscle cell membrane to deeper into the cell. Note that the partial A-bands lie near the outer muscle cell but do not extend as deeply as normal A-bands. Fig. 7. unc-89(syb797 syb1257) animals that express HA-UNC-89 isoforms with an in-frame deletion of the interkinase region show extra A-bands that are not full-depth. Open in a new tab After immunostaining with antibodies to MHC A (A) or antibodies to UNC-89 (B) multiple optical slices with a 0.2 μm interval were obtained by structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Yellow and blue arrows point to examples of short extra A-bands that lie between normally located A-bands and reside close to the outer muscle cell membrane. In comparison, unc-89(syb797) that expresses HA-UNC-89 shows parallel, normally spaced and full-depth A-bands. Scale bar, 5 μm. In C. elegans , the body wall muscle is required for the animal to generate the forces required for its normal swimming, crawling and burrowing locomotion [ 33 ]. Given the disorganization of sarcomeres in the body wall muscle of nematodes expressing large isoforms of UNC-89 with an in-frame deletion of the IK, we wondered if these animals would display defects in movement or in muscle force generation. First, because our strain with the IK deletion also contains an N-terminal HA tag, we measured locomotion in the strain with the HA tag alone, syb797 . As shown in Fig. 8A and B , syb797 is not slower in swimming or crawling as compared to wild type. In fact, syb797 displays a statistically faster swimming than wild type. However, clearly, syb797syb1257 , containing both an HA tag and IK deletion shows a 15% reduction in swimming and a 30% reduction in crawling ( Fig. 8A and B ). This decrease in swimming speed is comparable to that displayed by the canonical unc-89 allele e1460 , but not as severe as that of alleles su75 or tm752 ( Fig. 8A ). The decrease in crawling of the IK deletion strain is not as severe as 3 of 4 other alleles tested ( e1460, su75, tm752 ). In terms of muscle force exerted, as measured by the NemaFlex assay [ 34 ], all mutant alleles (including syb797 syb1257 ) except for tm752 are defective compared to wild type ( Fig. 8C ). Interestingly, syb797 , which has an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large isoforms, shows no decrease in crawling, but an increase in swimming, and decreased ability to generate force. This phenotype of increased speed of swimming, no change or even increased speed of crawling, and yet decreased force, is shared with the allele ad539 . unc-89(ad539) , like syb797 , has normally organized sarcomeres in body wall muscle, which likely accounts for lack of any decrease in swimming or crawling. (We first showed that unc-89(ad539) has normally organized sarcomeres by EM [ 2 ], but to verify this result we have immunostained its muscle with a variety of antibodies to sarcomeric proteins, and all of these are normally localized ( Supplemental Figure 5 )). Fig. 8. Whole worm locomotion and muscle force measurements of wild type and various unc-89 mutant alleles. Open in a new tab (A) Swimming assays show that unc-89(syb797) and unc-89(ad539) swim faster than wild type, whereas all other unc-89 mutants, including unc-89(syb797 syb1257) swim slower than wild type. (B) Crawling assays show that unc-89(ad539) crawls faster than wild type, that unc-89(syb797) crawls at the same speed as wild type, and all other unc-89 mutants crawl more slowly than wild type. C) NemaFlex force measurements show that unc-89(tm752) develops the same muscle force as wild type, whereas all other unc-89 mutants develop less force than wild type, although, unc-89(syb797 syb1257) , unc-89(e1460) , and unc-89(su75) are more severely affected. The actual data, including sample sizes, means, and standard errors are shown in Supplementary Table 1 for swimming and crawling and Supplementary Table 2 for NemaFlex measurements. In C. elegans , the pharynx is a neuromuscular pump required for bringing bacterial food into the worm and grinding it up before its entry into the intestine. unc-89(ad539) was first isolated in a screen for mutants that show defective feeding behavior, and found to be an allele of unc-89 by complementation testing and 3 factor mapping; by polarized light microscopy the pharyngeal muscle was shown to have reduced birefringence and abnormal arcs in the terminal or posterior bulb [ 35 ]. Based on this, and the similarity of ad539 with syb797 , we examined the pharyngeal muscle structure of both these alleles, and additional alleles of unc-89 using polarized light microscopy ( Fig. 9 ). As first noted by Waterston et al. [ 1 ], in unc-89(e1460) , instead of the radially oriented filaments observed in the posterior bulb of wild type, this mutant has longitudinally oriented filaments at the periphery of the bulb (indicated by yellow arrow in Fig. 9 ). In fact, all the unc-89 mutants that we imaged show this defect except for tm752 , which shows normal pharyngeal muscle organization. Remarkably, syb797 , with the HA tag, shows the same defect. However, ad539 shows not only the defect in the terminal bulb; it also shows a defect in the anterior bulb (blue arrows in Fig. 9 ). The only other unc-89 allele that shows both bulbs affected is su75 . Fig. 9. Polarized light images of the myofilament lattice in the pharynges of wild type and various unc-89 mutant alleles. Open in a new tab Yellow arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the terminal bulb, and blue arrows indicate mis-localized arc-like thick filaments at the periphery of the anterior bulb. Note that unc-89(tm752) shows pharyngeal muscle like wild type, whereas all the other unc-89 mutants show defective organization. unc-89(su75) and unc-89(ad539) are the only alleles that show defects in both the posterior and anterior bulbs. Scale bar, 50 μm. To understand the pharyngeal muscle defect further, we examined the expression of UNC-89 protein in the pharynges of wild type, syb797 and ad539 . This was done by co-immunostaining worms with antibodies to UNC-89 and to the pharyngeal myosin heavy chain MHC C [ 36 ]. We have previously demonstrated that in wild type, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments in pharyngeal muscle [ 4 ]. As shown in Fig. 10 , UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments throughout the pharynx. However, in syb797 there is no detectable expression of UNC-89 in the posterior bulb. In ad539 there is no observable expression of UNC-89 throughout the pharynx. Moreover, MHC C staining reveals that in both syb797 and ad539 , there are abnormal accumulations of thick filaments at the periphery of the posterior bulb (indicated by yellow arrows in Fig. 10 ), corresponding to the arcs observed by polarized light. The expression defects in the mutants seem to correspond with the defects in pharyngeal muscle organization and indicate that UNC-89 is required for normal organization of sarcomeres in pharyngeal muscle.

Note that unc-89(syb797) shows reduced UNC-89 expression in the terminal bulb, whereas unc-89(ad539) shows reduced UNC-89 expression in both the terminal and anterior bulbs.

    "Conclusion": "In this study, we explored the biophysical properties and in vivo function of an example of ~600 aa sequence that has similar features (low sequence complexity, lack of predicted domains and minimal levels of predicted secondary structure elements) and location between two protein kinase domains in the UNC-89/obscurin class of giant muscle proteins. In the case of UNC-89 IK, which was studied here, as shown in Fig. 1B , JPred predicts only short stretches of α-helices, primarily in the C-terminal third of the IK, and the majority of the sequence is predicted to be random coil. By use of single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro ( Fig. 2 ) we showed that this IK sequence, is likely to be a random coil since it acts like an entropic spring upon application of pulling force. The nature of the IK sequence (random coil) and its physical properties (entropic spring) is shared with the highly elastic spring elements (PEVK, N2B) of another giant muscle protein, titin [ 37 ]. In the case of titin, there is good evidence to suggest that these elements unwind when muscle sarcomeres are stretched beyond their relaxed state, store potential energy and then provide a passive restoring force to allow the sarcomeres to return to their resting (relaxed) lengths [ 38 ]. To test the secondary structure prediction and have a better understanding of the response of IK to pulling force, we conducted Far-UV circular dichroism on I27-I27-IK(571)-I27-I27, and as a control protein, a polyprotein containing 9 identical repeats of the I27 domain (I27 9 polyprotein). As Supplemental Figure 6 shows the overall secondary structure of the I27 polyprotein (dotted line) is similar to published data on I27 polyproteins [ 39 ] showing maximum around 200 nm a minimum at ~212nm, a characteristic of a mainly β-strand structure. The overall CD spectra for the IK-I27 construct (solid line) shows a shift of the minimum to a lower wavelength (~208nm) and no clear maximum ~200 nm indicating a reduced β-strand structure and an additional random-coil component. Hence, these structural data are consistent with our AFM and JPred results and demonstrates that the interkinase region displays the properties of a random coil. To explore the muscle function of the IK, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create a worm strain, syb797syb1257 , in which most of the IK of UNC-89 was deleted in-frame. This strain also has its giant UNC-89 isoforms N-terminally tagged with HA. syb797syb1257 also seems to show reduced expression of the UNC-89 giant isoforms similar to that shown by the HA tagged strain, syb797 (an example is shown in Fig. 5B ). However, in contrast to syb797 which shows normal body wall muscle sarcomere organization, syb797syb1257 , shows highly disorganized body wall muscle sarcomeres. Therefore, the body wall muscle sarcomere defect in syb797syb1257 is likely caused by the lack of the IK. The normal location of UNC-89 is the M-line, the structure in which thick filaments are cross linked in the middle of the A-band. Deletion of the IK, in addition to disrupting the normal continuous and parallel M-lines or A-bands, results in formation of short A-bands which are not full-depth but confined to the portion nearest the outer muscle cell membrane, and these occur between normally spaced A-bands. Sarcomere assembly is known to occur from the outside inwards, first with the deposition of ECM proteins like perlecan, followed by localization of integrins, and then localization of integrin adhesion proteins (UNC-112 (kindlin), PAT-4 (ILK), UNC-97 (PINCH), PAT-6 (α-parvin), followed by assembly of M-line or dense body (Z-disk)-specific proteins [ 40 , 41 ]. We know that UNC-89 interacts with CPNA-1 [ 11 ], which in turn interacts with PAT-6, a member of the 4- protein complex that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of PAT-3 (β-integrin)[ 42 ]. It should be noted that CPNA-1 interacts with Ig1-Ig3, which is near the N-terminus of UNC-89 and remote from IK. Our results seem to indicate that these protein interactions at the membrane are not sufficient for full assembly of a M-line/A-band, and the proper spacing between A-bands. Either the length or the elasticity of UNC-89 IK is required. In future experiments, we can determine the minimum length of IK that is sufficient for full A-band assembly, and whether elasticity is crucial. We could replace the elastic IK with a sequence of similar length that is rigid. An example of a rigid sequence that could be used is the series of 4 consecutive Ig domains in human titin that are not separated by linker sequences [ 43 ]. It is tempting to speculate that the length of the interkinase is important for somehow determining the spacing between adjacent A-bands. Another possibility is that deletion of the IK in some way interferes with the activity of the active protein kinase domain of UNC-89 PK2. This is not likely because inactivation of PK2 does not result in a defect in sarcomere organization (Matsunaga et al., manuscript in preparation). So far, we have only examined the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres in adult muscle. Therefore, we cannot distinguish a role for UNC-89 IK for sarcomere assembly vs. sarcomere stability. Indeed, it is likely that UNC-89 has more of a role in maintaining or stabilizing sarcomere structure: In strong loss of function alleles like unc-89(e1460) , A-band organization is normal in early larvae [ 22 ], despite the fact that UNC-89 is expressed even in embryonic muscle [ 44 ]. In vertebrate muscle, the M-band is known to be elastic and helps titin maintain the registration of adjacent thick filaments during muscle contraction [ 45 ]. The cross-linking of thick filaments occurs by the binding of antiparallel dimers of myomesin to myosin of thick filaments. The M-band also includes complex interactions between Obsl1 and obscurin with titin, and myomesin with obscurin [ 46 ]. Although much of the elasticity and mechanical protection is provided by myomesin [ 47 , 48 ], our results suggest that the IK region of obscurin, which also lies in the M-band also provides some of this elasticity. Because whole animal locomotion (swimming, crawling) and force generation are diminished upon removal of the IK, we also have learned that the level of sarcomere organization found in this mutant is not sufficient for proper contractile activity. In contrast, the better level of sarcomere organization in unc-89 ( tm752) is sufficient to generate normal force but is not sufficient to generate normal swimming or crawling speeds. Our IK deletion strain also contains an HA tag appended to the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. We designed this for future immunoprecipitation experiments to further test whether UNC-89 interacting partners that we have discovered primarily through two hybrid screens are actually associated with UNC-89: we would create in-frame deletions of segments of UNC-89 that are suspected to bind to a partner, then IP those internally deleted UNC-89 proteins, and look for absence of the association. Somewhat surprisingly, this HA tag reduces the level of expression of the giant UNC-89 isoforms to approximately half of their wild type levels in whole worm extracts. And although the HA tag does not affect the organization of sarcomeres in body wall muscle or the ability of whole animals to swim or crawl, it does reduce the ability to generate muscle force. In addition, the HA tag results in a defect in thick filaments in the terminal bulb of the pharynx. Moreover, the level of expression of UNC-89 is reduced in the terminal bulb, consistent with the western blot result. This suggests that the HA tag at the N-terminus either reduces the stability of pharyngeal-specific UNC-89 mRNA or protein isoforms, or interferes with interaction with binding partners found only in pharyngeal muscle. Although our extensive yeast two-hybrid screens did not reveal any binding partners for the N-terminus of UNC-89, these screens cannot reveal all relevant binding partners. Also, it is possible that the HA tag reduces the steady state levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms in both pharyngeal and body wall muscle, below a critical level required for pharyngeal but not for body wall muscle sarcomere assembly and/or stability. The reduced force generated by syb797 containing the HA tag is also puzzling. However, it should be noted that syb797 and ad539 share these properties—each has normal body wall muscle, but defective pharyngeal muscle. Then, why do these two mutants generate less force? In fact, the only mutant studied that generates normal force is tm752 that does so despite having mildly disorganized body wall muscle. The key to explaining why these two mutants generate less force appears to be their reduced body diameters. In fact, as shown in Table 1 , all the mutants generating less force have smaller than wild type body diameters, and defective pharynxes. tm752 has a normal body diameter and a normal pharynx. Our speculation is that all the mutants with defective pharynxes have reduced nutrition and consequently are smaller. Although our force measurements were normalized for body diameter, it is possible that reduced nutrition results in reduced metabolism and reduced energy production, and thus less ability to generate force. It is also curious that both syb797 and ad539 display greater swimming speeds and ad539 shows greater crawling speed. Perhaps this is because these thinner animals can bend more easily. Table 1.

Thus, in the future, cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in human obscurin might be studied in C. elegans by creating the analogous mutations in unc-89 , and using these mutants for genetic suppressor and drug screens.",
