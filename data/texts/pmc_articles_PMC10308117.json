    "Abstract": "Abstract A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella , designated as F6_2S_P_1 T . The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1 T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1 T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli . Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli . Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1 T , C. rhizosphaerae , and C. ginsengisoli , along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis . Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1 T and other members of this clade.

    "Results": "Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T isolated from the ISS was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization to determine its phylogenetic affiliation. In addition, WGSs of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae were generated and compared with the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Assembly statistics for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1, C. ginsengisoli , and C. rhizosphaerae are summarized in Table 1 . Genome sizes are 9.06 Mb for strain F6_2S_P_1, 7.22 Mb for C. ginsengisoli , and 8.5 Mb for C. rhizosphaerae . GC content ranged from 58.37% for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T to 59.49% for C. rhizosphaerae . In general, among 39 sequenced Cohnella genomes, genome size varied from 4.0 to 9.4 Mb. This genome variation should be investigated for any functional genes acquired or shed over time. Table 1. Assembly statistics for hybrid Illumina and Nanopore assembly of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T .

F6_2S_P_1 T and C. ginsengisoli , and C. rhizosphaerae were 88.4 and 88.0%, respectively ( Table 2 ). ANI between Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T and all other named Cohnella species for which a genome was publicly available was <79.4% ( Table 2 ). We also tested ANI between Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T and available genomes for unnamed Cohnella species and found that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 were also closely related, with ANIs of 88.9 and 88.0%, respectively. This was also the trend for C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae , which showed ANI to each other and to Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 ranging from 88 to 92%, and which was otherwise most closely related to C. nanjingensis with an ANI value of ~79%. The dDDH results showed a similar pattern, as values were 35 and 34.5% between Cohnella sp.

The 16S rDNA sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1 T with the members of this clade ranged from 98.84 to 97.37%. “ C. plantaginis” and “ C. capsici” form their own well-supported branch within this clade, while C. rhizosphaerae is basal to strain F6_2S_P_1 T and C. ginsengisoli is the most basal species of the clade ( Figure 1 ). However, branch support for the divergence of strain F6_2S_P_1 T from C. rhizosphaerae was low (50) and not shown in Figure 1 . A gyrB-based phylogeny was also generated using all publicly available Cohnella genomes plus the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris ( Figure 2 ). The gyrB sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1 T with the members of this clade ranged from 93.99 to 93.55%. The gyrB tree supports the position of strain F6_2S_P_1 T as non-basal to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , with C. ginsengisoli as the most basal species in this branch of the genus Cohnella . Since WGSs of “ C. plantaginis” and “ C. capsici” are not available, they were not included in the gyrB phylogeny. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, showing the inclusion of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T in a branch of the genus including species isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere soil. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on gyrB sequences of the genus Cohnella . The genome-based tree ( Figure 3 ) for all sequenced and fully described Cohnella species was based on a concatenated alignment of 14 gene clusters containing a total of 294 single-copy core genes common to all species in the genus. This tree supports the position of C. rhizosphaerae as basal to C. ginsengisoli , in contrast to the 16S and gyrB trees. Nevertheless, the position of strain F6_2S_P_1 T remains the same. A second genome-based tree was generated using a second pangenome analysis including genomes of all Cohnella species along with yet-to-be described species ( Supplementary Figure S1 ), which showed that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 are also part of this clade, with Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 as the most basal species and Cohnella sp. OV330 as basal to C. ginsengisoli and strain F6_2S_P_1 T . Figure 3. Open in a new tab Phylogenetic tree based on 294 single-copy core genes shared by all available Cohnella species genomes. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization Light microscopy and staining with safranin and malachite green show that cells are rod-shaped and vary extensively in length and that strain F6_2S_P_1 T forms ellipsoidal/oval endospores which quickly convert back to vegetative cells ( Figure 4 ). SEM imaging reveals the presence of peritrichous flagella attached to F6_2S_P_1 T cells ( Figure 5A ) and confirms the presence of elongated cells ( Figure 5B ). Figure 4.

Differentiating biochemical characteristics of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T with other Cohnella species are depicted in Table 3 . Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T grew at temperatures between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies were weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. Catalase positive in C. ginsengisoli, C. plantaginis , and C. capsici ; absence of growth at 3% NaCl and production of oxidase in C. ginsengisoli ; absence of endospore formation in C. rhizosphaerae ; nitrate reduction not seen in C. plantaginis and C. capsica were some of the phenotypic characteristics that could differentiate Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T from other Cohnella species. Table 3. Phenotypic characteristics of strain F6_2S_P_1 T and closely related species of genus Cohnella .

Major fatty acids (more than 5% of the total) are C16:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, and anteiso-C15:0 ( Table 4 ). Differences in fatty acid profile of strain F6_2S_P_1 T with regard to C. rhizosphaerae CSE-5610 T , Cohnella ginsengisoli DSM 18997 T , C. plantaginis YN-83 T , and C. capsici YN-59 T are shown in Table 4 . C. rhizosphaerae showed >25% of C16:0 saturated fatty acid, whereas other Cohnella species exhibited <10% production. Absence of branched fatty acid such as iso-C14:0 in Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T and in C rhizosphaerae could be used to differentiate the novel species described in this study. However, production of iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0 was very high in Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T when compared to other described Cohnella species. Table 4. Percentage of total cellular fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T and closely related species of genus Cohnella .

The polar lipid profile was composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, a phospholipid, and minor amounts of unidentified polar lipid ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). This profile is in agreement with other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade (Kim et al., 2010 ; Kampfer et al., 2014 ; Wang et al., 2015 ). The quinone system contained menaquinones MK-7 (98%) and MK-8 (2%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain F6_2S_P_1 T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid, which is the case for other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade where that data are reported. All other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade also contain MK-7 as the dominant menaquinone (Kim et al., 2010 ; Kampfer et al., 2014 ; Wang et al., 2015 ). Descriptions of C. capsici and C . plantaginis do not report low abundance menaquinones, but the quinone system of F6_2S_P_1 T is similar to that of C. rhizosphaerae (99.8% MK-7, 0.2% MK-8), while C. ginsengisoli has 93% MK-7 and 7% MK-6. Comparative genomic analysis of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade The genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T contained 309 genes not aligned with other species of Cohnella , named or undescribed ( Figure 6 ). Of these genes, 121 of them received an annotation from at least one predictive database. Annotated genes specific to strain F6_2S_P_1 T were dominated by the COG pathways of carbohydrate and/or amino acid transport and metabolism (27 genes), transcription (10 genes), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (11 genes), and signal transduction mechanisms (+ transcription) (18 genes). The large number of carbon-cycling metabolic genes found in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T within Cohnella is unsurprising, given the diverse nature of the carbon substrates which strain F6_2S_P_1 T , C. capsici , and C. plantaginis can metabolize compared to the fairly limited substrates utilized by C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli ( Table 3 ). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pangenomic analysis of the genus Cohnella , including C. hashimotonis sp. nov. (pink) as well as its previously unsequenced closest relatives C. rhizosphaerae (blue) and C. ginsengisoli (green). Because C. capsici and C. plantaginis are both characterized as fixing N 2 , the annotations for the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T were searched extensively for genes having to do with nitrogen fixation, as well as blastn and blastx searches for key genes involved in N 2 fixation. However, despite the presence of the gene nifU in most species of the genus Cohnella , there was no indication that strain F6_2S_P_1 T encodes for N 2 fixation. Other genes of interest predicted by annotation on the RAST platform include multiple genes for endospore formation and for the plant growth hormone auxin, genes which are likely shared by many members of the genus Cohnella , which belongs to the order Bacillales (including many known spore formers) and which are common plant endophytes. BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T via the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the species Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Zhu et al., 2016 ). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multiple Bacillus and Paenibacillus endophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al., 2022 ; Semenzato et al., 2022 ). The genomes of C. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae , and strain F6_2S_P_1 T all contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, with C. ginsengisoli containing one that is a 100% match, while C. nanjingensis (the most closely related species outside the C. ginsengisoli clade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in the C. rhizosphaerae which is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome of C. nanjingensis (vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome of C. rhizosphaerae . Strain F6_2S_P_1 T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N 2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al., 1997 ), but as strain F6_2S_P_1 T does not contain a full suite of genes for N 2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. No genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence were predicted by the ABRicate pipeline. The entire closely related branch of which strain F6_2S_P_1 T is a member, which we term the C. ginsengisoli clade (due to its basal position and status as the first officially described species within the clade), contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other publicly available Cohnella genome. All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1 T were originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, including C. ginsengisoli (isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al., 2010 ), C. rhizosphaerae (isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al., 2014 ), C. capsici (isolated from Capsicum rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2015 ), C. plantaginis (isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2012 ), Cohnella sp. OV330 (isolated from poplar rhizosphere, JGI, 2015 ), and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 (isolated from Ginko biloba root tissue, Zou et al., 2021 ). It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1 T might have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed. Cohnella was one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al., 2022 ). Cohnella was also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020 ). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses, Cohnella species might have not been identified appropriately. Functional enrichment analysis for the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella species using the COG20 and KOfam databases revealed hundreds of statistically significantly enriched predicted functions ( p < 0.05 with FDR adjustment) annotating one or more gene clusters, including 11 functions which were detected in all C. ginsengisoli clade members ( Supplementary Table S1 ) but in none of the rest of the genus. Most notably, C. ginsengisoli clade species were enriched in genes for heme oxygenase and for a bacteriophytochrome (annotated on NCBI as diguanylate cyclase), which were detected using both COG20 and KOfam database annotation. Consensus protein sequences for genes related to these functions, when aligned to the NCBI database, most closely match to the genome of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus (after matches to members of the C. ginsengisoli clade); heme oxygenase and diguanylate cyclase are located one after the other in the assembled chromosome of this species ( NZ_CP026520.1 ). Heme oxygenase (HO-1) breaks down heme and releases iron and is a regulator of intracellular iron availability in plants and animals (Singh and Bhatla, 2022 ). Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla, 2022 ); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al., 2019 ). In bacteria, expression and production of heme oxygenase are associated with iron scavenging within a host, and heme oxygenase expression can have either beneficial anti-oxidant or enhanced pathogenic effects on plant or animal hosts (Richard et al., 2019 ). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, heme oxygenase also produces biliverdin which is used as the chromatophore in bacteriophytochromes (Takemoto et al., 2019 ). It is also possible that this HO-1/diguanylate cyclase complex acts as an oxygen sensor (Martínková et al., 2013 ). Other functions significantly enriched in this clade include stress response genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ. KEGG pathway analysis predicted two functional pathways in all C. ginsengisoli clade species which were not present in any other Cohnella species: a pathway for carbon fixation (incomplete reductive citrate cycle) and a pathway for plant terpenoid biosynthesis (specifically beta-carotene biosynthesis). Predictive analysis of the presence of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes, Drula et al., 2022 ) was followed by ordination ( Figure 7 ; Supplementary Figure S3 ) and heatmap generation ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). Both heatmaps and ordinations show that strain F6_2S_P1 T and its closest relatives cluster tightly together, along with C. fermenti (isolated from a fermented vegetable, Lin et al., 2020 ) , C. phaseoli (isolated from the root nodule of a legume species, Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008 ) , C. zeiphila (isolated from corn tissue, Johnson et al., 2021 ), and several undescribed strains; members of the C. ginsengisoli clade, therefore, appear to be both taxonomically similar and have similar profiles of carbohydrate-cycling genes. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that the centroid of the C. ginsengisoli clade was significantly different from that of other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species ( p < 0.001). One axis out of three in the NMDS ordination clearly differentiates the C. ginsengisoli clade and the other Cohnella species mentioned above from the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (NMDS2, shown in Figure 7 ; Supplementary Figure S3 ); therefore, scores correlating CAZyme ordination vectors to this axis using the envfit function were assessed for significance, plotted, and ranked against the axis in question. Figure 7. Open in a new tab First two axes of NMDS ordination (standardization = “range,” distance = “Bray-Curtis,” maxit = 500, k = 3, stress = 0.129, R 2 = 0.98) for counts of different predicted CAZymes in the genomes of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species. Also present in the figure are CAZyme vector correlations with axes 1 and 2 (not original coordinates) via envfit/Pearson's correlation with fdr correction + p < 0.01. Species belonging to the C. ginsengisoli clade and the top 4 CAZyme families/subfamilies positively correlated with axis 2 are labeled. Most strongly associated with this axis and the C. ginsengisoli clade are the CAZyme families CBM67 and GH78, which were both identified as part of the enzyme α-L-rhamnosidase which alters flavonoids and other rhamnose-containing glycosides such as pectins in plant cell walls (Yadav et al., 2010 ). Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds ( Xie et al., 2022 ) . The C. ginsengisoli clade and other Cohnella species enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds. CAZymes negatively associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade (and associated mainly with Paenibacillus species) include chitosanases (GH46 and CBM12), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GH85), and β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GT17). Four CAZyme families associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species had an effect size of 0.5 or greater (Kruskal–Wallis); these were maltooligosaccharide-producing α-amylases (CG13_5), chondroitin AC lyase (PL8_3), and alginate lyases (PL34 and PL14_3). Presence of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T in ISS metagenomes Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces, crew capsule, and ISS HEPA filter particulates (Venkateswaran et al., 2014 ; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019 ; Urbaniak et al., 2022 ) were mapped to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T . Most metagenomes had <0.05% of reads that mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1 T , with a maximum of 0.22% of reads mapping to strain F6_2S_P_1 T for a low-read-number sample collected from the cupola of the ISS during Flight 4 of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series. But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1 T , 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1 T is not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, since Cohnella species were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants. For example, as mentioned above, Cohnella was an abundant genus in the microbiome of healthy plant tissue of chili plants grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2022 ).",
    "Conclusion": "Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T isolated from the ISS was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization to determine its phylogenetic affiliation. In addition, WGSs of C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae were generated and compared with the genome of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T to identify the variable, conserved, and distinctive genomic traits. Genome characteristics and relatedness indices Assembly statistics for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1, C. ginsengisoli , and C. rhizosphaerae are summarized in Table 1 . Genome sizes are 9.06 Mb for strain F6_2S_P_1, 7.22 Mb for C. ginsengisoli , and 8.5 Mb for C. rhizosphaerae . GC content ranged from 58.37% for Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T to 59.49% for C. rhizosphaerae . In general, among 39 sequenced Cohnella genomes, genome size varied from 4.0 to 9.4 Mb. This genome variation should be investigated for any functional genes acquired or shed over time. Table 1. Assembly statistics for hybrid Illumina and Nanopore assembly of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T .

F6_2S_P_1 T and all other named Cohnella species for which a genome was publicly available was <79.4% ( Table 2 ). We also tested ANI between Cohnella sp.

This was also the trend for C. ginsengisoli and C. rhizosphaerae , which showed ANI to each other and to Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp.

The 16S rDNA sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1 T with the members of this clade ranged from 98.84 to 97.37%. “ C. plantaginis” and “ C. capsici” form their own well-supported branch within this clade, while C. rhizosphaerae is basal to strain F6_2S_P_1 T and C. ginsengisoli is the most basal species of the clade ( Figure 1 ). However, branch support for the divergence of strain F6_2S_P_1 T from C. rhizosphaerae was low (50) and not shown in Figure 1 . A gyrB-based phylogeny was also generated using all publicly available Cohnella genomes plus the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris ( Figure 2 ). The gyrB sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1 T with the members of this clade ranged from 93.99 to 93.55%. The gyrB tree supports the position of strain F6_2S_P_1 T as non-basal to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , with C. ginsengisoli as the most basal species in this branch of the genus Cohnella . Since WGSs of “ C. plantaginis” and “ C. capsici” are not available, they were not included in the gyrB phylogeny. Figure 1. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, showing the inclusion of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T in a branch of the genus including species isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere soil. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on gyrB sequences of the genus Cohnella . The genome-based tree ( Figure 3 ) for all sequenced and fully described Cohnella species was based on a concatenated alignment of 14 gene clusters containing a total of 294 single-copy core genes common to all species in the genus. This tree supports the position of C. rhizosphaerae as basal to C. ginsengisoli , in contrast to the 16S and gyrB trees. Nevertheless, the position of strain F6_2S_P_1 T remains the same. A second genome-based tree was generated using a second pangenome analysis including genomes of all Cohnella species along with yet-to-be described species ( Supplementary Figure S1 ), which showed that Cohnella sp. OV330 and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 are also part of this clade, with Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 as the most basal species and Cohnella sp. OV330 as basal to C. ginsengisoli and strain F6_2S_P_1 T . Figure 3.

Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization Light microscopy and staining with safranin and malachite green show that cells are rod-shaped and vary extensively in length and that strain F6_2S_P_1 T forms ellipsoidal/oval endospores which quickly convert back to vegetative cells ( Figure 4 ). SEM imaging reveals the presence of peritrichous flagella attached to F6_2S_P_1 T cells ( Figure 5A ) and confirms the presence of elongated cells ( Figure 5B ). Figure 4.

Differentiating biochemical characteristics of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T with other Cohnella species are depicted in Table 3 . Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T grew at temperatures between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies were weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. Catalase positive in C. ginsengisoli, C. plantaginis , and C. capsici ; absence of growth at 3% NaCl and production of oxidase in C. ginsengisoli ; absence of endospore formation in C. rhizosphaerae ; nitrate reduction not seen in C. plantaginis and C. capsica were some of the phenotypic characteristics that could differentiate Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T from other Cohnella species. Table 3. Phenotypic characteristics of strain F6_2S_P_1 T and closely related species of genus Cohnella .

C. rhizosphaerae showed >25% of C16:0 saturated fatty acid, whereas other Cohnella species exhibited <10% production. Absence of branched fatty acid such as iso-C14:0 in Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T and in C rhizosphaerae could be used to differentiate the novel species described in this study. However, production of iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0 was very high in Cohnella sp.

The polar lipid profile was composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, a phospholipid, and minor amounts of unidentified polar lipid ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). This profile is in agreement with other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade (Kim et al., 2010 ; Kampfer et al., 2014 ; Wang et al., 2015 ). The quinone system contained menaquinones MK-7 (98%) and MK-8 (2%). The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain F6_2S_P_1 T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid, which is the case for other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade where that data are reported. All other described members of the C. ginsengisoli clade also contain MK-7 as the dominant menaquinone (Kim et al., 2010 ; Kampfer et al., 2014 ; Wang et al., 2015 ). Descriptions of C. capsici and C . plantaginis do not report low abundance menaquinones, but the quinone system of F6_2S_P_1 T is similar to that of C. rhizosphaerae (99.8% MK-7, 0.2% MK-8), while C. ginsengisoli has 93% MK-7 and 7% MK-6. Comparative genomic analysis of C. hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade The genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T contained 309 genes not aligned with other species of Cohnella , named or undescribed ( Figure 6 ). Of these genes, 121 of them received an annotation from at least one predictive database. Annotated genes specific to strain F6_2S_P_1 T were dominated by the COG pathways of carbohydrate and/or amino acid transport and metabolism (27 genes), transcription (10 genes), cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (11 genes), and signal transduction mechanisms (+ transcription) (18 genes). The large number of carbon-cycling metabolic genes found in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T within Cohnella is unsurprising, given the diverse nature of the carbon substrates which strain F6_2S_P_1 T , C. capsici , and C. plantaginis can metabolize compared to the fairly limited substrates utilized by C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli ( Table 3 ). Figure 6. Open in a new tab Pangenomic analysis of the genus Cohnella , including C. hashimotonis sp. nov. (pink) as well as its previously unsequenced closest relatives C. rhizosphaerae (blue) and C. ginsengisoli (green). Because C. capsici and C. plantaginis are both characterized as fixing N 2 , the annotations for the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T were searched extensively for genes having to do with nitrogen fixation, as well as blastn and blastx searches for key genes involved in N 2 fixation. However, despite the presence of the gene nifU in most species of the genus Cohnella , there was no indication that strain F6_2S_P_1 T encodes for N 2 fixation. Other genes of interest predicted by annotation on the RAST platform include multiple genes for endospore formation and for the plant growth hormone auxin, genes which are likely shared by many members of the genus Cohnella , which belongs to the order Bacillales (including many known spore formers) and which are common plant endophytes. BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T via the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the species Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Zhu et al., 2016 ). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multiple Bacillus and Paenibacillus endophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al., 2022 ; Semenzato et al., 2022 ). The genomes of C. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae , and strain F6_2S_P_1 T all contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, with C. ginsengisoli containing one that is a 100% match, while C. nanjingensis (the most closely related species outside the C. ginsengisoli clade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in the C. rhizosphaerae which is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome of C. nanjingensis (vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome of C. rhizosphaerae . Strain F6_2S_P_1 T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N 2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al., 1997 ), but as strain F6_2S_P_1 T does not contain a full suite of genes for N 2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. No genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence were predicted by the ABRicate pipeline. The entire closely related branch of which strain F6_2S_P_1 T is a member, which we term the C. ginsengisoli clade (due to its basal position and status as the first officially described species within the clade), contained 322 gene clusters not found in any other publicly available Cohnella genome. All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1 T were originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, including C. ginsengisoli (isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al., 2010 ), C. rhizosphaerae (isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al., 2014 ), C. capsici (isolated from Capsicum rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2015 ), C. plantaginis (isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al., 2012 ), Cohnella sp. OV330 (isolated from poplar rhizosphere, JGI, 2015 ), and Cohnella sp. GbtcB17 (isolated from Ginko biloba root tissue, Zou et al., 2021 ). It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1 T might have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed. Cohnella was one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al., 2022 ). Cohnella was also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2020 ). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses, Cohnella species might have not been identified appropriately. Functional enrichment analysis for the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella species using the COG20 and KOfam databases revealed hundreds of statistically significantly enriched predicted functions ( p < 0.05 with FDR adjustment) annotating one or more gene clusters, including 11 functions which were detected in all C. ginsengisoli clade members ( Supplementary Table S1 ) but in none of the rest of the genus. Most notably, C. ginsengisoli clade species were enriched in genes for heme oxygenase and for a bacteriophytochrome (annotated on NCBI as diguanylate cyclase), which were detected using both COG20 and KOfam database annotation. Consensus protein sequences for genes related to these functions, when aligned to the NCBI database, most closely match to the genome of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus (after matches to members of the C. ginsengisoli clade); heme oxygenase and diguanylate cyclase are located one after the other in the assembled chromosome of this species ( NZ_CP026520.1 ). Heme oxygenase (HO-1) breaks down heme and releases iron and is a regulator of intracellular iron availability in plants and animals (Singh and Bhatla, 2022 ). Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla, 2022 ); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al., 2019 ). In bacteria, expression and production of heme oxygenase are associated with iron scavenging within a host, and heme oxygenase expression can have either beneficial anti-oxidant or enhanced pathogenic effects on plant or animal hosts (Richard et al., 2019 ). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, heme oxygenase also produces biliverdin which is used as the chromatophore in bacteriophytochromes (Takemoto et al., 2019 ). It is also possible that this HO-1/diguanylate cyclase complex acts as an oxygen sensor (Martínková et al., 2013 ). Other functions significantly enriched in this clade include stress response genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ. KEGG pathway analysis predicted two functional pathways in all C. ginsengisoli clade species which were not present in any other Cohnella species: a pathway for carbon fixation (incomplete reductive citrate cycle) and a pathway for plant terpenoid biosynthesis (specifically beta-carotene biosynthesis). Predictive analysis of the presence of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes, Drula et al., 2022 ) was followed by ordination ( Figure 7 ; Supplementary Figure S3 ) and heatmap generation ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). Both heatmaps and ordinations show that strain F6_2S_P1 T and its closest relatives cluster tightly together, along with C. fermenti (isolated from a fermented vegetable, Lin et al., 2020 ) , C. phaseoli (isolated from the root nodule of a legume species, Garcia-Fraile et al., 2008 ) , C. zeiphila (isolated from corn tissue, Johnson et al., 2021 ), and several undescribed strains; members of the C. ginsengisoli clade, therefore, appear to be both taxonomically similar and have similar profiles of carbohydrate-cycling genes. PERMANOVA analysis confirmed that the centroid of the C. ginsengisoli clade was significantly different from that of other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species ( p < 0.001). One axis out of three in the NMDS ordination clearly differentiates the C. ginsengisoli clade and the other Cohnella species mentioned above from the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species (NMDS2, shown in Figure 7 ; Supplementary Figure S3 ); therefore, scores correlating CAZyme ordination vectors to this axis using the envfit function were assessed for significance, plotted, and ranked against the axis in question. Figure 7.

Also present in the figure are CAZyme vector correlations with axes 1 and 2 (not original coordinates) via envfit/Pearson's correlation with fdr correction + p < 0.01. Species belonging to the C. ginsengisoli clade and the top 4 CAZyme families/subfamilies positively correlated with axis 2 are labeled. Most strongly associated with this axis and the C. ginsengisoli clade are the CAZyme families CBM67 and GH78, which were both identified as part of the enzyme α-L-rhamnosidase which alters flavonoids and other rhamnose-containing glycosides such as pectins in plant cell walls (Yadav et al., 2010 ). Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds ( Xie et al., 2022 ) . The C. ginsengisoli clade and other Cohnella species enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds. CAZymes negatively associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade (and associated mainly with Paenibacillus species) include chitosanases (GH46 and CBM12), endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (GH85), and β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GT17). Four CAZyme families associated with the C. ginsengisoli clade compared to other Cohnella and Paenibacillus species had an effect size of 0.5 or greater (Kruskal–Wallis); these were maltooligosaccharide-producing α-amylases (CG13_5), chondroitin AC lyase (PL8_3), and alginate lyases (PL34 and PL14_3). Presence of Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1 T in ISS metagenomes Metagenomic reads from ISS surfaces, crew capsule, and ISS HEPA filter particulates (Venkateswaran et al., 2014 ; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019 ; Urbaniak et al., 2022 ) were mapped to the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1 T . Most metagenomes had <0.05% of reads that mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1 T , with a maximum of 0.22% of reads mapping to strain F6_2S_P_1 T for a low-read-number sample collected from the cupola of the ISS during Flight 4 of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series. But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1 T , 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1 T is not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, since Cohnella species were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants. For example, as mentioned above, Cohnella was an abundant genus in the microbiome of healthy plant tissue of chili plants grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al., 2022 ).",
