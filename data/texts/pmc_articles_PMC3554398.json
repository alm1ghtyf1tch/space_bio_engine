    "Abstract": "Abstract The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.

    "Results": "Quantitative PCR Total bacterial burden, as assessed by bacteria-directed qPCR, is given in Table 1 . When PMA treatment was omitted before molecular processing, the total bacterial burden (viable+non-viable) of the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples was ∼10 5 to 10 6 rRNA gene copies m −2 . Samples collected from the inactive Bldg 144 facility floor and GSE yielded 1 to 2-logs higher rRNA gene copy numbers than SAF samples both with and without PMA treatment. Following treatment with PMA, a mere 7% (floors) and 4% (GSE) of the total bacterial population encountered about the mission-critical SAF was determined to be viable. However, the bacterial population present in PMA-treated Bldg 144 samples was 21% (floors) and 7% (GSE) viable. On comparative analysis, Bldg 144 floors housed a 188-fold greater viable bacterial burden than their mission-critical SAF counterparts. Similarly, Bldg 144 GSE samples contained 25-fold more viable bacteria than their SAF GSE equivalents. bTEFAP analysis A breakdown of the number of MOTU observed in the various samples examined over the course of this study is provided in Table 1 . Overall, Bldg 144 cleanroom floor samples housed 3.6-fold more bacterial MOTU than the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor, whereas the GSE surfaces from each of these cleanrooms yielded a roughly equivalent number of MOTU. The effect of PMA treatment was significantly higher in both SAF (97% MOTU reduction) and Bldg 144 (75% MOTU reduction) floor samples, which indicated the presence of a large number of dead cells or extraneous DNA on these floors. A similar trend was observed in PMA-treated GSE samples from SAF (reduced from 425 to 17 MOTU) and Bldg 144 (reduced from 571 to 42 MOTU). A breakdown of MOTU, at the level of bacterial phyla or class, observed in the various samples examined is detailed in Table 2 . The mission-critical SAF floor retained MOTU affiliated with physiologically recalcitrant bacteria (Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes), whereas the Bldg 144 cleanroom floor harbored predominantly proteobacterial MOTU. It was particularly apparent that a few acidobacterial types (4 MOTU) were present in great abundance (112 sequences) in the SAF floor samples. However, the GSE samples exhibited no such correlation between MOTU numbers and sequence occurrence. A closer examination of the pyrosequence reads resulting from the SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples indicated a predominance of members of the genera: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Arsenicicoccus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Kineococcus, Propionibacterium, Nocardioides, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Deinococcus and Staphylococcus . Many of the sequences arising from the physiologically recalcitrant bacteria observed in cleanroom floor samples sans PMA treatment were absent or in very low number in the PMA-treated fractions of the very same sample.

Although equivalent surface areas were sampled from the floors and GSE of the two cleanrooms studied (9 m 2 each), the Bldg 144 samples gave rise to many more pyrosequence reads than the SAF floor samples. Regardless of sample type, PMA-treated sample fractions consistently yielded considerably fewer pyrosequences than their untreated counterparts. Anywhere from 14 to 2196 high-quality pyrosequences (>250 bp) were obtained from samples that had been pre-treated with PMA, whereas 1783 to 15 914 high-quality pyrosequences were recovered from untreated samples. Even when PMA treatment was omitted, the mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor sample (GI-36-4) yielded far fewer pyrosequences (1783 reads) than the Bldg 144 cleanroom floor sample (GI-42-1; 15 914 reads). The relative abundance of pyrosequences retrieved from the PMA-untreated cleanroom floor samples is plotted as a Venn diagram in Figure 1a . Approximately 65% of the pyrosequences retrieved from these two distinct facility floor samples were detected in both cleanrooms, although this shared fraction represented only 8% of the total observed MOTU (46 out of 569; Figure 1a ). The relative abundance of pyrosequences retrieved from the untreated SAF samples is plotted as a Venn diagram in Figure 1b . Between the SAF floor and GSE samples, ∼38% of the total number of detected pyrosequence reads were shared, although this constituted a mere 7.8% of the total MOTU (43 out of 547). Figure 1.

Parentheses denote total number of pyrosequences generated and the numerals without parentheses are total number of MOTU present in that sample. PhyloChip analysis A drastic decrease in the total number of bacterial genera was observed in all samples on pre-treatment with PMA ( Table 1 ). After having been treated with PMA, the SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples exhibited very simple bacterial community structure, housing very few genera (9 and 3, respectively) of Firmicute and Proteobacteria lineage. Without PMA treatment, these very same floor and GSE samples yielded many more genera, which represented a diverse assemblage of taxa ( Table 3 ) dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The Bldg 144 cleanroom floor and GSE samples also presented many more genera without PMA pre-treatment (199 and 236, respectively) than the very same samples having been treated with PMA (106 and 75).

A heatmap was generated based on the transformed hybridization intensities of detected PTU ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). Such analysis clearly illustrates a marked decrease in the hybridization scores of all samples treated with PMA, as compared with the very same samples not treated with PMA. For instance, the SAF GSE sample (GI-36-3) exhibited very high transformed hybridization intensities for detected PTU sans PMA treatment. However, when treated with PMA, this very same sample showed a dramatic reduction in all resulting hybridization intensity scores, which suggested that the majority of the detected 16S rRNA genes arose from deceased members of the community. In order to identify the viable members that exhibited increased hybridization intensities after PMA treatment, ratios of non-PMA-treated and PMA-treated hybridization scores were calculated for each PTU, and are presented as a heatmap ( Figure 2 ). An observed increase in the transformed hybridization intensity of a given PTU following PMA treatment would likely stem from PCR bias in non-PMA-treated samples, where high levels of DNA originating from non-viable cells are co-amplified. This amplification of template DNA arising from non-viable cell types masks the presence of smaller levels of DNA template arising from viable cells. Hence, transformed hybridization intensities are elevated on removing the template DNA arising from non-viable cells from the equation (that is, PMA-treated sample fraction). The SAF cleanroom floor and GSE samples gave rise to fewer PTU with higher transformed hybridization ratios. At the same time, PMA-treated Bldg 144 cleanroom samples were richer in PTU having increased transformed hybridization intensity ratios, which was indicative of a relatively greater viable population. These PTU belonged to the Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. A phylogenetic tree of PhyloChip PTU grouped at the family level is provided as Supplementary Figure 2 , which shows the presence of the detected families in each sample with and without PMA treatment. Figure 2. Open in a new tab Heatmap of PTU that increased in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated samples compared with non-PMA-treated samples and were called present in the PMA-treated sample. An increase in transformed hybridization intensities in PMA-treated sample is reflected as a positive ratio. In total, 801 PTU were identified that fulfilled this requirement, which were grouped into 70 genera. Displayed are representatives of all genera with the most drastic changes for each sample pair. Numbers in parentheses are the total number of PTU. Statistical analysis of microbial community profiles The various samples examined by bTEFAP analysis consistently showed lower Shannon–Wiener diversity indices when treated with PMA compared with their corresponding non-treated samples ( Supplementary Table 1 ). PCoA was performed to study the environmental clustering and relatedness of community profiles derived from bTEFAP and PhyloChip analyses ( Figure 3 ). All of the samples analyzed without PMA treatment clustered together, indicative of their relatively similar community structure, compared with their coinciding PMA-treated sample fractions. The clustering observed in the PCoA plot was congruent with the dendogram clustering presented in Supplementary Figure 1 , which implied a close association among all non-PMA samples. Multi-response permutation procedure analysis was performed to assess the difference in community structure between PMA-treated sample fractions and non-PMA-treated sample fractions, derived by both bTEFAP and PhyloChip analysis. The null hypothesis (no difference in PMA-treated and non-PMA-treated samples) was rejected based on the significance of the delta for both bTEFAP and PhyloChip analyses (0.028 and 0.037, respectively). The chance-corrected within-group agreements were fairly low for bTEFAP sequence data ( A =0.0411) but high ( A =0.2605) for PhyloChip data, which reflect the observed grouping in PCoA. In addition, Adonis testing clearly showed a significant change in the detected community profiles after PMA treatment ( P -value bTEFAP: 0.04, P -value PhyloChip: 0.02). Based on the multiple statistical approaches used, such as Adonis, multi-response permutation procedure, a Euclidean distance-based dendogram ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), and ordination (PCoA) analyses ( Figure 3 ), it was clear that PMA-treated samples and non-PMA samples were significantly dissimilar with respect to diversity in bacterial community profiles.

    "Conclusion": "Over the past 25 years, sequence analysis of PCR-amplified rRNA genes has become the ‘gold standard' for assessing species richness in mixed microbial communities, and as a result, total resolvable microbial diversity is now estimated to be threefold greater than that based solely on cultivation ( Pace, 1997 ). As sequences from organisms in greatest abundance are far more likely to be represented in clone libraries than those from singleton and low-abundance taxa, it is advantageous to use high-throughput technologies, such as bTEFAP and PhyloChip, which have been shown to render a far superior representation of community structure ( Brodie et al. , 2006 ; Sogin et al. , 2006 ; DeSantis et al. , 2007 ; La Duc et al. , 2009 ). The application of PMA to assess the differential viability of microbial cells is increasing in popularity within the scientific community ( Nocker et al. , 2009 ; van Frankenhuyzen et al. , 2011 ). When used to pre-treat samples, the PMA concentration applied in this study effectively precluded ∼90% of the total DNA template molecules from downstream manipulation, resulting in the generation of only 2827 pyrosequences, whereas 27 449 pyrosequences were obtained from the very same samples without PMA pre-treatment. With respect to diversity, all of the pyrosequences generated after PMA treatment represented a mere 171 MOTU, which corresponded to ∼12% of the total number of MOTU resulting from the very same samples without PMA treatment ( Table 2 ). Furthermore, 2- to 3-logs fewer pyrosequences arose from PMA-treated than untreated mission-critical cleanroom samples (0.8% for floor; 2.1% for GSE). The total number of MOTU observed in the operational mission-critical SAF cleanroom floor sample (122 MOTU) was considerably less than that associated with the quiescent Bldg 144 cleanroom floor (447 MOTU). Bioinformatic analyses of pyrosequence data demonstrated that both of these contaminant microbial populations comprised only Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The vast majority of these bacteria, if not all, were present in the SAF mission-critical cleanroom floor samples in a non-viable state. However, about 25% of the detected MOTU (108 out of 447) were observed to be viable in the Bldg 144 facility, suggesting that certain taxa are able to withstand the desiccated and nutrient-deprived conditions of these cleanroom floors (sample #GI-42-1). Actinobacterial genera such as Kineococcus, Kocuria, Modestobacter and Propionibacterium were present in high abundance in the JPL-SAF floor samples. In contrast, the floors of the Bldg 144 facility housed predominantly Proteobacterial genera, as Brevendimonas and Acinetobacter pyrosequences were generated in great numbers. Previously, members of these and other closely related genera have been isolated from spacecraft assembly environments ( Osman et al. , 2008 ; La Duc et al. , 2009 ; Ghosh et al. , 2010 ; Vaishampayan et al. , 2012 ). The molecular biological detection and isolation of these robust microbial lineages from spacecraft-associated environments is of particular consequence to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) planetary protection practices, not to mention routine validation of these cleanroom facilities. Unlike cleanroom floors, which were treated with Kleenol 30 detergent, the GSE materials housed in either cleanroom were subjected only to alcohol wiping, and yet gave rise to similar MOTU and pyrosequence occurrence, with GSE materials kept at the Bldg 144 facility marginally enriched (∼1.3-fold increase in pyrosequences and MOTU). From these results, it is apparent that GSE need to be subjected to more rigorous cleaning regimens, as GSE-associated richness was two to four times greater than that of the floor surfaces. The most frequently encountered bacterial MOTU from the stringently maintained and frequently cleaned floors of the SAF cleanroom were members of the genera: Bacillus, Clostridium and Nocardia. These bacteria are known to survive oligotrophic conditions for extended periods of time, tolerate alkaline and oxidative stress, and avoid death by ultraviolet radiation by morphing into highly resilient, dormant endospores ( La Duc et al. , 2007 ; Ghosh et al. , 2010 ; Probst et al. , 2010 ). Although routine cleaning and maintenance regimens limit the number of bacterial taxa capable of persisting in cleanrooms, hardy spore-forming microorganisms like Bacillus spp. , Clostridium spp. and Nocardia spp. capitalize on their selective advantage and superior fitness and survive—much to the chagrin of those challenged with bioreduction and sterilization of these environments. The presence of these organisms is detected as a result of their (a) viability, or (b) inability to be penetrated by PMA molecules while in a non-viable state. Owing to subtle nuances inherent in the PMA-chemistry-coupled techniques described herein, endospores and non-viable cells having intact cell walls and/or outer membranes will escape PMA treatment ( Nocker et al. , 2009 ; Rawsthorne et al. , 2009 ; Probst et al. , 2012 ), and thus be observed as false-positive viable entities. Similarly, sampling and sample processing steps (for example, the composition of the solution to collect and store microorganisms, method for cell concentration and PMA treatment) might affect the viability of the cells but in a recent study such adverse effect of sample handling procedures was not noticed for sea and canal water samples ( Kort et al. , 2010 ; Nocker et al. , 2010 ). As was observed via bTEFAP procedures, PhyloChip-based analyses discerned noticeable differences in the bacterial diversity profiles resulting from PMA- and non-PMA-treated samples. One such observation was the reduction in diversity of proteobacteria detected in PMA-treated samples and prevalence of proteobacteria in samples not treated with PMA. Another consistent result was the observed prevalence of Firmicutes in the PMA-treated samples. This suggests that Gram-positive bacteria are more tolerable of the inhospitable conditions of the cleanroom environment that their Gram-negative kin. Numerous studies have reported varying accounts of the microbial diversity typical of spacecraft-associated cleanrooms, and what the presence of such communities might portend for life detection endeavors in extraterrestrial settings ( Venkateswaran et al. , 2001 ; La Duc et al. , 2004 , 2007 ; Moissl et al. , 2007 ; Probst et al. , 2010 ; Vaishampayan et al. , 2010 ). Indeed, the introduction of contaminant microbes to extraterrestrial environments could have profound repercussions on (a) the scientific integrity of in situ and sample-return based life detection experiments, and (b) the uncompromised nature of such settings. The worst-case scenario for life-detection experimentation would be the inadvertent transfer of viable contaminant microbiota to an otherwise pristine location of interest. The results of this study are encouraging, as they suggest that hitherto, the breadth of diversity enveloped within the viable fraction(s) of typical spacecraft-associated microbial communities have been overestimated. At the same time, these findings enabled the first ever statistically significant differentiation between the total and viable-only portion of microbial communities in cleanroom environments. Significant differences were shown between these two populations using two independent profiling methods, namely bTEFAP and PhyloChip G3. Consequently, these methodologies are an attractive means of discerning viable phylotypes in low-biomass environments. Such a capability is of crucial importance and benefit to numerous industries (for example, healthcare, pharma, semiconductor fabrication), not least of all the NASA, whose planetary protection program is tasked with ensuring spacecraft-borne microorganisms do not result in harmful contamination of extraterrestrial environments.",
