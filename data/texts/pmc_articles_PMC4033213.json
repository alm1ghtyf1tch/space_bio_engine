    "Abstract": "Abstract Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both agents. The “replication fork” checkpoint, governed by ATR, played a slightly more important role in resistance to HZE-induced mutagenesis than in resistance to gamma induced mutagenesis.

    "Results": "THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF HZE 56 Fe PARTICLES IS APPROXIMATELY 3-FOLD GREATER THAN THAT OF 137 Cs GAMMA RAYS WITH RESPECT TO INHIBITION OF PRIMARY ROOT GROWTH To test the relative impact of high- versus low-LET radiation on root growth, a process governed by both cell division and cell expansion, seeds were irradiated with either high-LET 56 Fe particles (HZE) or low-LET 137 Cs gamma rays. The length of the primary root 8 days after planting (DAP), relative to the length in unirradiated seeds, is shown in Figure 1 . Consistent with previously published data, exposure to increasingly higher doses of gamma radiation results in increased inhibition of root elongation ( Jiang et al., 1997 ). A similar, though more pronounced trend is observed in seeds exposed to HZE. At doses of 100 Gy HZE or higher, root elongation appears to be almost completely inhibited in wild-type lines, though seeds irradiated at such doses are still capable of germination, indicating that the treated embryos remain alive. FIGURE 1. Open in a new tab Relative root growth of irradiated seeds 8 days after treatment. (A) Gamma treatment. (B) HZE treatment. Data points reflect results from three ( n = 3) biological replicates in the case of atm , and atr and four ( n = 4) biological replicates in the case of wild-type, lig4 and ku80 (Doses for which only a single biological replicate was performed are displayed as hollow data points.). Rootlengths from an average of 29 seedlings were scored per line, per treatment, per replicate. Lines represent interpolation of the data, fit to a sigmoid curve. Error bars depict standard error of the mean, as calculated and plotted by Microsoft Excel. Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), defined as the absorbed dose of radiation of a standard type (e.g. gamma) divided by the absorbed dose of radiation type “ x ” that causes the same amount of biological damage, offers a means of comparing how damaging different types of radiation are, given the same amount of absorbed energy; the larger the RBE for a type of radiation, the more damaging the radiation per unit energy deposited ( Failla and Henshaw, 1931 ). The RBE of HZE versus gamma radiation was estimated by interpolating the dose response data to determine the dose at which the length of the primary root is reduced to 37% that of the untreated control (ID 1 /e ; Table 1 ). In the case of both our wild-type and mutant lines, the effect of HZE on primary root growth is significantly greater than that of gamma rays. The biological effectiveness of HZE versus gamma in our repair-deficient lines is slightly lower than observed in wild-type. Somewhat more variance is observed in our checkpoint-deficient lines. Lines deficient for ATM exhibit a slight increase in root sensitivity to HZE versus gamma radiation relative to wild-type (RBE = 3.63 versus 2.97), while lines deficient for ATR exhibit a slight decrease in their relative HZE sensitivity (2.09). Whether this shift in root hypersensitivity is a function of cell death resulting from a failed checkpoint induction, or from prolonged cell-cycle arrest is unclear from the root growth data.

GENOMIC INSTABILITY IN SEEDS EXPOSED TO HZE 56 Fe PARTICLES IS GREATER THAN THAT OBSERVED IN SEEDS EXPOSED TO 137 Cs GAMMA RAYS While the root hypersensitivity assay indicates that exposure to HZE has a more pronounced effect, per Gy on the growth of seedlings than does exposure to gamma radiation, it fails to shed much light on long-term effects on genomic stability. In order to address the impact HZE and gamma radiation have on the integrity of the genome, we employed a sectoring assay to test for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in treated seeds ( Preuss and Britt, 2003 ). An albino marker gene ( apg3 ) near the tip of chromosome III was introduced to a series of DNA repair defective lines and checkpoint defective lines. While seedlings homozygous for the albino marker arrest and die shortly after germination, untreated seedlings heterozygous for the marker appear phenotypically identical to wild-type. Loss of the wt allele marker in a heterozygous single cell, whether as a result of anueploidy, loss of the distal portion of the chromosome, or mutation of the wild-type allele, followed by production of mutant cell files via cell division, results in the production of an albino sector ( Figure 2 , inset) The frequency with which these sectors occur within a population provides a measure of genomic stability ( Yoshiyama et al., 2009 ). FIGURE 2. Open in a new tab Loss of heterozygosity following exposure to radiation. Loss of heterozygosity in wild-type plants treated with HZE (black line) and gamma (gray line) radiation. Data points represent the mean of three biological replicates; dashed lines depict linear regressions of datasets. Error bars depict standard deviation, as calculated by standard statistical methods in Mircosoft Excel. Inset: example of an IR-induced albino sector. As expected, under normal conditions, genomic stability in wild-type plants appears quite high. To obtain an estimate of the rate of spontaneous LOH at the APG3 locus in wild-type plants, 900 untreated plants were scored for the presence of an albino sector. Of the 900 plants scored, none exhibited the presence of a sector, suggesting a rate of spontaneous LOH per plant for this particular allele of less than 0.1%. In seeds treated with low does of either HZE or gamma radiation, sectoring increases with dose in a roughly linear, positive fashion ( Figure 2 ). However, plants treated with higher doses are very small, and exhibit decreasing frequencies of sectoring/plant, perhaps simply because fewer cells are sampled per plant. Sectoring frequency in seeds treated with 56 Fe particles was consistently higher than that observed in seeds treated with gamma rays; these results are consistent with the observation that in human cells, clustered damage generated by Fe ions leads to increases in chromosome breakage and genomic instability ( Asaithamby et al., 2011 ). To obtain an estimate of the biological effectiveness of HZE versus gamma radiation, in the context of long-term genomic stability, linear regressions were generated from the sectoring data ( Figures 2 and 3 , inset). Regressions were constrained such that they passed through the origin, and the ratio of the slopes from the HZE and gamma datasets was determined. In wild-type plants, a 3.33-fold increase in sectoring was observed in seeds treated with HZE as compared to those treated with gamma rays ( Table 2 ). In the case of lig4 and ku80 , the 50 Gy gamma and 200 Gy HZE datapoints were omitted in the regression analysis due to a drop-off in sectoring at higher doses as discussed in the following section. FIGURE 3. Open in a new tab Loss of heterozygosity in repair-deficient plants in response to HZE and gamma radiation. Data points represent the mean of three biological replicates. An average of 216 plants were scored per line, per treatment, per replicate. Error bars depict standard deviation, as calculated by standard statistical methods in Microsoft Excel. Inset: Linear regressions for each dataset. Note: as described in the text, the 50 Gy HZE and 200 Gy Gamma data points were excluded from the regression analysis. Table 2.

LINES DEFECTIVE IN DNA DSB REPAIR EXHIBIT A DECREASE IN GENOMIC STABILITY Given the significant roles LIG4 and the KU70/KU80 heterodimer play in NHEJ ( Friesner and Britt, 2003 ), we sought to determine the importance of these factors in maintaining genomic stability during the repair of IR-induced DSBs. As in the case of wild-type, at low doses, our lig4 and ku80 lines exhibited a roughly linear increase in the frequency of sectoring with exposure to increased levels of radiation; however, unlike our wild-type line, a significant drop-off in sectoring was observed at higher doses of either HZE or gamma radiation ( Figure 3 ). Again, we believe this is due to the very small size of the repair-defect plants after irradiation at these doses. Of the mutant lines tested, plants lacking LIG4 exhibited the highest rate of sectoring following exposure to IR ( Table 2 ). Although research has demonstrated that DSBs can be rejoined in the absence of LIG4, its role as the primary ligase involved in NHEJ is well documented ( Grawunder et al., 1998 ; Tsukamoto and Ikeda, 1998 ; Junop et al., 2000 ; Friesner and Britt, 2003 ; van Attikum et al., 2003 ; Huefner et al., 2011 ). The increased rate of LOH in lig4 is almost certainly the result of persistent DSBs present during cell division; whether the structure of these breaks precludes other ligases from rejoining the broken ends, or the ends are repaired in a more error-prone fashion is unclear. KU80, another important component of NHEJ, also appears to be involved in maintaining genomic stability following exposure to IR. Other work has shown that while the KU complex plays an important role in governing the size of deletions and insertions at DSB repair sites and in stabilizing broken ends prior to ligation, end-joining can still occur in its absence ( Ma et al., 2003 ; Boboila et al., 2010 ; Huefner et al., 2011 ). It is likely, therefore, that a relatively large portion of the broken DNA ends generated by IR are ultimately rejoined in our ku80 line resulting in the more moderate increase in sectoring observed in ku80 plants as compared to lig4 plants. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ATM AND ATR IN MAINTAINING GENOMIC STABILITY DIFFERS IN RESPONSE TO HZE VERSUS GAMMA RADIATION As with our DNA repair-deficient lines, a significant increase in sectoring was observed in our checkpoint-deficient lines relative to wild-type ( Figure 4 ). Such an increase is consistent with the role ATM and ATR play in governing the DSB driven, early G2/M phase arrest. Failure to properly arrest cells in response to DSBs could result in the presence of persistent DSBs during cell division, thereby leading to aneuploidy and LOH ( Garcia et al., 2003 ; Culligan and Britt, 2008 ). ATM and ATR function synergistically in response to IR-induced DNA damage, functioning in some ways redundantly and in other ways distinctly to activate downstream targets, trigger cell-cycle arrest, and help drive DNA repair. In light of the fact that ATM is thought to respond directly to DSBs via interaction with proteins associated with the breaks ( Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003 ; Lee and Paull, 2005 ), whereas ATR is thought to respond to the presence of persistent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ( Burrows and Elledge, 2008 ; Cimprich and Cortez, 2008 ), we were interested in whether ATM and ATR function differently in maintaining genomic stability in response to the damage caused by HZE versus gamma radiation. FIGURE 4. Open in a new tab Loss of heterozygosity in cell-cycle checkpoint-deficient plants in response to HZE and gamma radiation. Data points represent the mean of three biological replicates. Error bars depict standard deviation, calculated as before via Microsoft Excel. Inset: Linear regressions for each dataset. atm-1 seeds exposed to gamma radiation exhibit a 2.5-fold increase in the frequency of sectoring as compared to wild-type (calculated from the slopes reported in Table 2 ). A more moderate increase in sectoring, 1.9-fold, was observed in our atr line, suggesting that while both ATM and ATR play a role in maintaining genomic stability in response to gamma radiation exposure, ATM is of greater relative importance. In seeds exposed to HZE particles, an increase in sectoring was again observed in both atm and atr relative to wild-type. Fold increases of 1.9 and 2.2 were observed for atm and atr respectively, indicating a reversal in the relative importance of ATM and ATR in mitigating LOH in HZE versus gamma treated seeds, although these differences are small. Quantification of the RBE of HZE versus gamma, in terms of genomic stability, in our checkpoint-deficient lines demonstrates a decrease in the relative importance of ATM in response to HZE radiation as compared to wild-type (2.6 and 3.3, respectively), and an increase in the relative importance of ATR (3.9). Based on the LOH data, it appears that ATR plays a more important role in responding to the complex, clustered damage induced by HZE particles than it does in responding to damage induced by exposure to gamma radiation. Given that ATR responds to persistent ssDNA, one possible explanation for the increased importance ATR plays in response to HZE treatment, is that more ssDNA is produced directly upon exposure to HZE particles. Multiple nicks to the DNA backbone in close proximity to one another may produce significant stretches of ssDNA in conjunction with DSBs not typically present in breaks generated by low-LET radiation. Alternatively, ssDNA may also be produced secondarily in HZE treated cells as the cell attempts to repair the clustered damage via resection of damaged ends or excision of damaged nucleotides. In cells deficient for ATR, imposition of cell-cycle arrest in HZE treated cells may be abrogated or delayed, resulting in enhanced loss of heterozygosity in cells that divide before the damage can be resolved. This may also provide insight into the observation that relative to both wild-type and atm, root growth in atr is slightly more resistant to HZE treatment, given that affected cells, while incurring greater damage to the genome, may still be capable of cell division and expansion.",
    "Conclusion": "THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF HZE 56 Fe PARTICLES IS APPROXIMATELY 3-FOLD GREATER THAN THAT OF 137 Cs GAMMA RAYS WITH RESPECT TO INHIBITION OF PRIMARY ROOT GROWTH To test the relative impact of high- versus low-LET radiation on root growth, a process governed by both cell division and cell expansion, seeds were irradiated with either high-LET 56 Fe particles (HZE) or low-LET 137 Cs gamma rays. The length of the primary root 8 days after planting (DAP), relative to the length in unirradiated seeds, is shown in Figure 1 . Consistent with previously published data, exposure to increasingly higher doses of gamma radiation results in increased inhibition of root elongation ( Jiang et al., 1997 ). A similar, though more pronounced trend is observed in seeds exposed to HZE. At doses of 100 Gy HZE or higher, root elongation appears to be almost completely inhibited in wild-type lines, though seeds irradiated at such doses are still capable of germination, indicating that the treated embryos remain alive.

Relative biological effectiveness (RBE), defined as the absorbed dose of radiation of a standard type (e.g. gamma) divided by the absorbed dose of radiation type “ x ” that causes the same amount of biological damage, offers a means of comparing how damaging different types of radiation are, given the same amount of absorbed energy; the larger the RBE for a type of radiation, the more damaging the radiation per unit energy deposited ( Failla and Henshaw, 1931 ). The RBE of HZE versus gamma radiation was estimated by interpolating the dose response data to determine the dose at which the length of the primary root is reduced to 37% that of the untreated control (ID 1 /e ; Table 1 ). In the case of both our wild-type and mutant lines, the effect of HZE on primary root growth is significantly greater than that of gamma rays. The biological effectiveness of HZE versus gamma in our repair-deficient lines is slightly lower than observed in wild-type. Somewhat more variance is observed in our checkpoint-deficient lines. Lines deficient for ATM exhibit a slight increase in root sensitivity to HZE versus gamma radiation relative to wild-type (RBE = 3.63 versus 2.97), while lines deficient for ATR exhibit a slight decrease in their relative HZE sensitivity (2.09). Whether this shift in root hypersensitivity is a function of cell death resulting from a failed checkpoint induction, or from prolonged cell-cycle arrest is unclear from the root growth data.

In order to address the impact HZE and gamma radiation have on the integrity of the genome, we employed a sectoring assay to test for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in treated seeds ( Preuss and Britt, 2003 ). An albino marker gene ( apg3 ) near the tip of chromosome III was introduced to a series of DNA repair defective lines and checkpoint defective lines. While seedlings homozygous for the albino marker arrest and die shortly after germination, untreated seedlings heterozygous for the marker appear phenotypically identical to wild-type. Loss of the wt allele marker in a heterozygous single cell, whether as a result of anueploidy, loss of the distal portion of the chromosome, or mutation of the wild-type allele, followed by production of mutant cell files via cell division, results in the production of an albino sector ( Figure 2 , inset) The frequency with which these sectors occur within a population provides a measure of genomic stability ( Yoshiyama et al., 2009 ).

As expected, under normal conditions, genomic stability in wild-type plants appears quite high. To obtain an estimate of the rate of spontaneous LOH at the APG3 locus in wild-type plants, 900 untreated plants were scored for the presence of an albino sector. Of the 900 plants scored, none exhibited the presence of a sector, suggesting a rate of spontaneous LOH per plant for this particular allele of less than 0.1%. In seeds treated with low does of either HZE or gamma radiation, sectoring increases with dose in a roughly linear, positive fashion ( Figure 2 ). However, plants treated with higher doses are very small, and exhibit decreasing frequencies of sectoring/plant, perhaps simply because fewer cells are sampled per plant. Sectoring frequency in seeds treated with 56 Fe particles was consistently higher than that observed in seeds treated with gamma rays; these results are consistent with the observation that in human cells, clustered damage generated by Fe ions leads to increases in chromosome breakage and genomic instability ( Asaithamby et al., 2011 ). To obtain an estimate of the biological effectiveness of HZE versus gamma radiation, in the context of long-term genomic stability, linear regressions were generated from the sectoring data ( Figures 2 and 3 , inset). Regressions were constrained such that they passed through the origin, and the ratio of the slopes from the HZE and gamma datasets was determined. In wild-type plants, a 3.33-fold increase in sectoring was observed in seeds treated with HZE as compared to those treated with gamma rays ( Table 2 ). In the case of lig4 and ku80 , the 50 Gy gamma and 200 Gy HZE datapoints were omitted in the regression analysis due to a drop-off in sectoring at higher doses as discussed in the following section.

LINES DEFECTIVE IN DNA DSB REPAIR EXHIBIT A DECREASE IN GENOMIC STABILITY Given the significant roles LIG4 and the KU70/KU80 heterodimer play in NHEJ ( Friesner and Britt, 2003 ), we sought to determine the importance of these factors in maintaining genomic stability during the repair of IR-induced DSBs. As in the case of wild-type, at low doses, our lig4 and ku80 lines exhibited a roughly linear increase in the frequency of sectoring with exposure to increased levels of radiation; however, unlike our wild-type line, a significant drop-off in sectoring was observed at higher doses of either HZE or gamma radiation ( Figure 3 ). Again, we believe this is due to the very small size of the repair-defect plants after irradiation at these doses. Of the mutant lines tested, plants lacking LIG4 exhibited the highest rate of sectoring following exposure to IR ( Table 2 ). Although research has demonstrated that DSBs can be rejoined in the absence of LIG4, its role as the primary ligase involved in NHEJ is well documented ( Grawunder et al., 1998 ; Tsukamoto and Ikeda, 1998 ; Junop et al., 2000 ; Friesner and Britt, 2003 ; van Attikum et al., 2003 ; Huefner et al., 2011 ). The increased rate of LOH in lig4 is almost certainly the result of persistent DSBs present during cell division; whether the structure of these breaks precludes other ligases from rejoining the broken ends, or the ends are repaired in a more error-prone fashion is unclear. KU80, another important component of NHEJ, also appears to be involved in maintaining genomic stability following exposure to IR. Other work has shown that while the KU complex plays an important role in governing the size of deletions and insertions at DSB repair sites and in stabilizing broken ends prior to ligation, end-joining can still occur in its absence ( Ma et al., 2003 ; Boboila et al., 2010 ; Huefner et al., 2011 ). It is likely, therefore, that a relatively large portion of the broken DNA ends generated by IR are ultimately rejoined in our ku80 line resulting in the more moderate increase in sectoring observed in ku80 plants as compared to lig4 plants. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ATM AND ATR IN MAINTAINING GENOMIC STABILITY DIFFERS IN RESPONSE TO HZE VERSUS GAMMA RADIATION As with our DNA repair-deficient lines, a significant increase in sectoring was observed in our checkpoint-deficient lines relative to wild-type ( Figure 4 ). Such an increase is consistent with the role ATM and ATR play in governing the DSB driven, early G2/M phase arrest. Failure to properly arrest cells in response to DSBs could result in the presence of persistent DSBs during cell division, thereby leading to aneuploidy and LOH ( Garcia et al., 2003 ; Culligan and Britt, 2008 ).

Error bars depict standard deviation, calculated as before via Microsoft Excel. Inset: Linear regressions for each dataset. atm-1 seeds exposed to gamma radiation exhibit a 2.5-fold increase in the frequency of sectoring as compared to wild-type (calculated from the slopes reported in Table 2 ). A more moderate increase in sectoring, 1.9-fold, was observed in our atr line, suggesting that while both ATM and ATR play a role in maintaining genomic stability in response to gamma radiation exposure, ATM is of greater relative importance. In seeds exposed to HZE particles, an increase in sectoring was again observed in both atm and atr relative to wild-type. Fold increases of 1.9 and 2.2 were observed for atm and atr respectively, indicating a reversal in the relative importance of ATM and ATR in mitigating LOH in HZE versus gamma treated seeds, although these differences are small. Quantification of the RBE of HZE versus gamma, in terms of genomic stability, in our checkpoint-deficient lines demonstrates a decrease in the relative importance of ATM in response to HZE radiation as compared to wild-type (2.6 and 3.3, respectively), and an increase in the relative importance of ATR (3.9).
