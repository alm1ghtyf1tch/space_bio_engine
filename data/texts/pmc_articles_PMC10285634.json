    "Abstract": "We examined the effects of ∼30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and RR18). ...",
    "Results": "GSK3β content is reduced in muscles from spacefaring mice Soleus, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle samples from the flight (F), ground control (GC), and vivarium control (VIV) groups were obtained from the BION-M1 mission as well as the rodent research 1 (RR1), RR9, and RR18 (BuOE and saline-treated) missions through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. Absolute muscle mass data for the RR9 (soleus and TA) and RR1 (soleus) missions were reported in a recent study published by our group showing significant muscle atrophy. 18 Muscle mass data for the BION-M1 (soleus and EDL) mission were also reported previously where although both soleus and EDL muscles appeared to be smaller in the F group, there were no significant differences when compared with GC or VIV. 19 Muscle mass data for RR18 are reported here in Table S1 . We first characterized the effects of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation, and although there was no effect of spaceflight in the EDL or TA, we found significant differences in the soleus - a postural muscle that is most affected by microgravity exposure ( Figures S1–S7 ). To summarize the soleus data, we examined the fold-change response in the F group relative to the combined average of the GC and VIV control groups, as no differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups ( Figure 1 ). Across all missions, we observed significant reductions in total GSK3β content (-22-54%) compared with GCVIV control with a combined reduction of 36% ( Figure 1 A). When examining the overall effect of spaceflight on Ser9 phosphorylated GSK3β content, we found a combined 1.2-fold increase in phosphorylation, however, this was only statistically significant for the BION-M1 and RR18 saline cohorts. Unlike GSK3β content, we did not find a consistent reduction in GSK3α across all missions ( Figure 1 C). Similarly, we found no combined effect of spaceflight on Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3α ( Figure 1 D). Altogether, these findings suggest that spaceflight more prominently affects the GSK3β isoform by reducing its protein levels and, though not consistent for all missions, by also increasing its Ser9 phosphorylation.

(G) MHC IIx content. (H) MHC IIb content. Fold-change (FC) data were calculated for each mission by dividing the Flight group by the average of the combined GC and VIV groups. The combined dataset represents the mean ± SEM and p value (Student’s t test) for all FC data (RR1, RR9, RR18, and BION-M1). To help explain why GSK3β was lower in soleus muscles after spaceflight, we followed up on our previous findings showing that the fast-twitch EDL muscle has lower GSK3β content compared with the slow-twitch soleus. 13 We posited that the reduction in GSK3β found with spaceflight would be largely attributed to the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that occurs within the murine soleus. 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 Across all missions analyzed, there were signs of a slow-to-fast fiber type shift in the soleus after spaceflight with an average 30% and 61% reduction in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa, respectively ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S8 , and S9 ). Conversely, we found an average 4-fold and 2.9-fold increase in MHC IIx and IIb isoforms, respectively, in the soleus after spaceflight ( Figures 1 G, 1H, S8 , and S9 ). The reduction in type IIa is of particular interest as our immunofluorescent microscopy experiments indicate that in the soleus and EDL muscles from otherwise healthy mice (e.g., mobile control), GSK3β is most abundant in the type IIA fibers that are identified with MHC IIa ( Figure 2 ). Thus, the reduction in type IIA fibers found with spaceflight likely accounts for the reduction in GSK3β protein observed with spaceflight. Figure 2.

Scale bars are set to 200 μm. Muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increases soleus muscle size and strength under simulated microgravity conditions The reduction in GSK3β observed after spaceflight in the murine soleus could suggest that GSK3 has only a minimal role in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness. However, given that our analyses of GSK3 content was conducted in muscle samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceflight, we next wanted to determine the effects of GSK3 inhibition before microgravity-induced muscle unloading, and more importantly, before any change in fiber type distribution that would result in lowered GSK3β content. To this end, we employed the NASA developed HLS model to simulate microgravity exposure on Earth. To inhibit GSK3, we used a muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown (GSK3 mKD ) mouse model previously generated in our lab. 23 These mice display partial knockdown (-40-50%) of both GSK3 isoforms in the soleus ( Figure S10 ). In turn, these mice have significantly larger soleus muscles - both in absolute and relative to body mass terms ( Figure S10 ). Furthermore, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans show that these mice have lowered body fat % and increased lean mass % ( Figure S10 ). After 7 days of HLS, GSK3 mKD mice still had lowered % fat mass, elevated % lean mass, and increased soleus:body mass ratio when compared with GSK3 flox mice ( Figures 3 A–3E). However, although GSK3 mKD mice had larger soleus muscles after HLS ( Figure 3 ), normalizing the data to mobile controls demonstrated that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS as both GSK3 mKD and GSK3 flox mice experienced a ∼50–60% reduction in absolute soleus mass and a ∼40–50% reduction in normalized soleus mass ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Nonetheless, soleus muscles from GSK3 mKD HLS mice were still larger when compared to GSK3 flox HLS mice, which was further supported by H&E analysis and a rightward shift in fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) distribution ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Upon closer inspection, we also found that the GSK3 mKD HLS mice had a greater proportion of fibers with centrally located nuclei ( Figure 3 J), which is indicative of enhanced myogenic repair. Corroborating these findings, myogenic markers Pax7 and myogenin were significantly greater in HLS soleus muscles from GSK3 mKD mice versus GSK3 flox mice ( Figure 3 K). Furthermore, we found that soleus muscles from GSK3 mKD HLS mice also had greater MHC IIa, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) protein levels versus GSK3 mKD HLS mice ( Figure 3 L). With a significant reduction in MHC IIx ( Figure 3 L), these results provide evidence for an oxidative fiber type shift with muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown, which is consistent with our previous findings in mice treated with various pharmacological GSK3 inhibitors. 24 , 25 In terms of soleus muscle strength, we found that after HLS, GSK3 mKD mice displayed greater force production across submaximal and maximal frequencies ( Figure 3 M). This effect was not found in a mobile state ( Figure 3 N), and therefore, calculating the percent reduction in specific force (HLS mice relative to their respective mobile controls), we found that soleus muscles from GSK3 mKD mice had significantly greater preservation (e.g. lower % reduction) of force across submaximal and maximal stimulation frequencies ( Figure 3 O). Altogether, these results show that targeted GSK3 inhibition before muscle unloading can increase soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and the oxidative fiber type while also preserving muscle strength.

Characterizing GSK3 activation in bones after spaceflight and the effects of muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown on femur, tibia, and lumbar bone mineral density We then investigated the effects of microgravity exposure on GSK3β content and phosphorylation in femur bones obtained from the RR9 mission. As expected, DXA scan analysis of the femurs showed significantly reduced bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in the F group compared with the combined GCVIV control ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Additional micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of the tibia from these same mice demonstrated decrements in bone structure were apparent in the cortical bone outcomes, whereas no differences in trabecular bone outcomes were evident ( Table S2 ). Specifically, flight mice presented lower cortical area fraction and periosteal perimeter, which was aligned with lower cortical thickness, compared to GCVIV control mice. Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in the pGSK3β in the femur compared with GCVIV with no changes in total GSK3β content ( Figures 4 C–4E). This in turn led to a reduction in the phosphorylation status of GSK3β, and though it did not reach statistical significance ( Figure 4 F), it is perhaps indicative of greater GSK3β activation in murine bones after spaceflight.

For (A–F), GC and VIV controls were combined to increase statistical power. All values are presented as means ± SEM. Using the DXA scans from the GSK3 mKD and GSK3 flox mobile and HLS mice, we then performed bone-specific regional BMD analysis on the tibia, femur, and lumbar spine to determine whether muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown could provide positive effects on BMD crosstalk ( Figure 4 H). In the mobile state, we did not find any differences in region-specific BMD between GSK3 mKD and GSK3 flox mice ( Figures 4 G and 4H). However, after 7 days of HLS, we found that tibia BMD was greater in GSK3 mKD HLS mice versus GSK3 flox HLS mice ( Figure 4 I). A similar result was found in the lumbar spine; albeit, this was not statistically significant ( Figure 4 I). In terms of tissue crosstalk, we examined the effects of muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown on soleus muscle fibronectin type III domain-containing protein (FNDC5), which is the precursor for the myokine irisin that gets secreted out into circulation with exercise and activation of PGC-1α in muscle. 26 Irisin produced and secreted from muscle can promote bone strength and mass in mice; and has been shown to limit bone loss associated with HLS. 27 , 28 Here, we demonstrate that the increase in region-specific BMD found with GSK3 mKD was associated with a significant increase in FNDC5 in the soleus ( Figure 4 J). Though our study is limited in that we did not collect serum to measure irisin levels, we think it is possible that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown could positively impact BMD (particularly in the tibia and lumbar spine) by increasing PGC-1α and FNDC5 in muscle ( Figure 4 K).",
    "Conclusion": "Here, we questioned whether GSK3 would be a viable therapeutic target that when inhibited could prevent or limit the muscle and bone loss associated with spaceflight. To this end, we first examined the effects of at least 30 days of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation status in murine muscle and bone samples. We then supplemented this work with Earth-based HLS experiments in GSK3 mKD mice where we assessed muscle size and strength with region-specific BMD. In the postural soleus muscle, we found that GSK3β but not GSK3α was consistently and significantly reduced in the F group compared with GCVIV, which is in line with previous proteomics analysis from the BION-M1 mission (see Tables S1 and S4 from ref. 19 ) and indicates that the two isoforms may be differentially regulated during spaceflight. Indeed, these GSK3 isoforms are encoded by separate genes located on two different chromosomes ( Gsk3α, mouse chromosome 7; and Gsk3β, mouse chromosome 18). Furthermore, inhibitory Ser phosphorylation was only enhanced with the GSK3β isoform after spaceflight; albeit not consistently across all missions, whereas Ser phosphorylation of GSK3α was virtually unaltered, which again indicates the two GSK3 isoforms are differentially regulated with spaceflight. Although the observed reduction in GSK3β content and its increase in inhibitory Ser9 phosphorylation in the soleus may argue against its involvement in the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness found with muscle unloading and spaceflight, it may just reflect the slow-to-fast fiber type shift, namely a reduction in type IIA fibers which we have shown are particularly enriched with GSK3β. This is consistent with our previous findings showing that GSK3β is highly expressed in the soleus versus the EDL 29 as the soleus comprises nearly 50% IIA fibers versus the EDL, which only comprises 10% type IIA fibers. 30 Moreover, we previously found greater Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β in the EDL versus the soleus. 29 Alternatively, or perhaps congruently, it is also possible that these changes in GSK3β content and activation may point toward an adaptive/compensatory response aimed at limiting GSK3 activation to limit muscle atrophy and weakness. Providing additional GSK3 inhibition, preferably before the onset of muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type changes may then preserve muscle health and function during spaceflight. To establish whether GSK3 inhibition could potentially preserve muscle size and strength in response to microgravity exposure, we utilized the simulated microgravity HLS model. Our results show that muscle-specific genetic reduction before muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type shift increased soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and preserved muscle strength in the face of HLS. We elected to partially knockdown (-40-50%) both GSK3 isoforms despite the fact that only GSK3β was affected by spaceflight to limit any potential compensatory activation of GSK3α. In a previous study by Pansters et al., sole genetic deletion of Gsk3β appeared to have upregulated protein levels of GSK3α in the murine soleus. 31 In this study, the authors found that genetic knockdown of Gsk3β did not attenuate soleus muscle atrophy in response to HLS, however, they did find an acceleration in muscle recovery with reloading. 31 These findings are consistent with our present results showing that although muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased soleus muscle size, it did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS, but it did enhance myogenic signaling. Moreover, our findings extend those from Pansters et al. because they did not examine soleus muscle contractile force. In this respect, GSK3 mKD mice displayed greater force production versus GSK3 flox mice but only after 7 days of HLS and not in the mobile state. This suggests that the effect of GSK3 mKD on muscle strength only manifests after an added stress such as HLS; and it further suggests that in the face of HLS, GSK3 mKD mice exhibit a preservation of muscle force production that could be important for spaceflight. The increase in myogenic signaling observed with GSK3 mKD mice is also highly relevant to spaceflight. Though HLS is considered to be the Earth-based analog of spaceflight, the mechanisms behind the ensuing muscle atrophy and weakness with HLS versus actual spaceflight differ in many respects and there is actually very little overlap. 32 However, one common pathway that is negatively affected in both HLS and spaceflight is myogenesis. 32 Thus, the observed increase in myogenic signaling in GSK3 mKD HLS mice could potentially be translated to spaceflight; however, future studies that investigate the effects of spaceflight directly on these mice are required if not warranted. The GSK3 mKD HLS mice also displayed a promotion toward the oxidative phenotype with a significant increase in MHC IIa, PGC-1α, and COXIV. This suggests that the inhibition of GSK3 not only attenuates muscle atrophy and weakness but may also attenuate the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that could lead to decrements in muscle performance and fatigue resistance. These results are not entirely surprising given that we and others have shown that GSK3 inhibition in muscle can promote the oxidative fiber type and PGC-1α content. 24 , 25 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 Moreover, the increase in PGC-1α content in muscle can provide benefits outside of muscle by promoting the expression, production, and release of FNDC5 and irisin. Irisin is a myokine secreted from muscle that can positively impact bone mass and strength even in the face of HLS. 27 , 28 , 37 Specifically, genetic deletion of irisin in mice severely compromises bone strength and mass with an increased number of osteoclasts, 27 whereas, irisin treatment prevented bone loss with HLS and accelerated bone recovery in response to reloading in mice. 28 Here, we show that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased FNDC5 in muscle while also increasing BMD in the tibia and in the lumbar spine (though not statistically significant in the latter, p = 0.08). Combined with our results showing that GSK3β is overactive in bones (e.g., less inhibitory Ser phosphorylation) from obtained mice subjected to spaceflight, our study provides ample evidence in support of inhibiting GSK3 for the promotion of musculoskeletal health during spaceflight. In human astronauts, the inhibition of GSK3 before and during spaceflight could be achieved with pharmacological inhibitors such as lithium (Li), which is an already FDA-approved drug. It is most commonly used for the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, because Li also exerts adverse effects when taken at relatively high doses (serum [Li] concentration exceeding 1.0 mM) for a prolonged period of time, it must be prescribed within a narrow therapeutic range (0.5–1.0 mM serum concentration) (for review see ref. 38 ). Conversely, we have shown that treating mice with lower doses of Li (serum [Li] of 0.02 mM) increases soleus and EDL muscle specific force production while also promoting PGC-1α and the oxidative fiber type. 25 In cell culture, we have also shown that low dose Li supplementation augments myogenic differentiation and fusion, 29 which could have implications for spaceflight. In fact, pre-treating mice with a low dose of Li (10 mg/kg/day via drinking water) for 4 weeks before unloading the soleus muscle via tenotomy, inhibited GSK3 and increased soleus muscle size even in the face of tenotomy surgery ( Figure S10 ). In addition to muscle, Li has been shown to have osteoprotective effects. 2 , 10 , 14 , 15 , 16 In a recent and large epidemiological study, it was found that patients living with bipolar disorder and receiving Li treatment had reduced risk of developing osteoporosis. 39 This is consistent with our findings in mice whereby low dose Li supplementation augmented osteogenic signaling by inhibiting GSK3, which in turn activated the anabolic Wnt/β-catenin pathway. 10 It should be noted that Li has several osteoprotective effects acting on other pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) transduction pathways (for review see 40 ). Altogether, the results from our study warrant future investigations with spaceflight and/or HLS to examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 before and during microgravity exposure to further establish whether targeting GSK3 can exert musculoskeletal protection against spaceflight. Undoubtedly, other GSK3 inhibitors aside from Li that are more specific to GSK3 would be important to test and could include drugs like tideglusib, which is the most clinically advanced GSK3 inhibitor currently being tested for other diseases and conditions. 41 , 42 We have recently shown that tideglusib treatment can preserve muscle size, strength, and quality in dystrophic mice. 24 The limitations of our study include low sample size, particularly with the RR1 and BION-M1 missions. Although the RR1 mission was conducted in female mice, the limitation in sample size prevented us from truly examining any potential influence of biological sex. Future studies, with age-matched male and female mice, preferably part of the same mission, are required to better elucidate the potential sex-specific effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal system. Our study was also limited in that we were not able to obtain bone samples from all missions, and thus our analysis was restricted to the RR9 mission. Within this mission, μCT analyses of the tibia indicated that cortical bone was primarily affected by spaceflight. However, we suspect that limitations in sample size prevented us from detecting a statistically significant effect on trabecular bone. Indeed, previous μCT analyses in the lumbar vertebrae and femur from the BION-M1 mission showed significant reductions in trabecular bone outcomes in the F group versus GC and VIV controls. 43 In muscle, where we obtained samples from RR9, RR1, RR18, and BION-M1 missions, we utilized a “meta-analytical” approach with the fold-change response as the common measure of effect size. However, differences in experimental conditions (i.e., food, temperature, pressure, strain differences, age differences, and etc.) should not be discounted. These differences could have contributed to the differences in phosphorylation status of GSK3, where we found significant increases in Ser phosphorylation of GSK3 in BION-M1 and RR18 F soleus muscles but not in any other soleus muscles from RR1 or RR9. Finally, our study is limited in that we did not assess the effects of bone-specific Gsk3 deletion on BMD and strength in response to HLS. Future studies should generate these mice and perform these experiments to firmly establish whether GSK3 inhibition before simulated microgravity exposure can protect against bone loss. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that inhibiting GSK3 specifically in muscle may exert positive effects on the bone thereby highlighting a muscle-to-bone connection that would likely be activated with whole-body GSK3 inhibition afforded through pharmacological means. In summary, our study shows that GSK3 content and activation status are altered in murine soleus and bone samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceflight. Although GSK3β content was reduced after spaceflight, our results with the simulated microgravity HLS model shows that inhibiting GSK3 before muscle unloading via muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion can increase muscle mass, myogenic signaling, and can preserve muscle force production. Moreover, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion may also help to maintain bone mass by increasing PGC-1α and FNDC5; and thus, future studies aboard the ISS are warranted to examine whether these mice are protected against spaceflight-induced declines in musculoskeletal health. In addition, future studies that examine the effects of pharmacological, and thus, whole-body GSK3 inhibition before and during spaceflight should also be done in mice. Collectively, our present study represents an important first step in hopes of enabling longer duration spaceflight missions to Mars – possibly through GSK3 inhibition.",
