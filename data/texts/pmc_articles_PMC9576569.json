    "Results": "Lipid metabolic processes are the most common biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight Previous studies showed that the muscle and the liver are differentially affected by metabolic changes during spaceflight ( da Silveira et al., 2020 ). Here, we first investigated the commonalities between the two organs. We chose to focus on the quadriceps, which is the most important in term of size and as such potentially in terms of effects. Transcriptomic data from C57BL/6J mouse liver and quadriceps from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol were analyzed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method and visualized with Cytoscape software ( Figure 1 A). In the quadriceps, “fatty coA process” and “axon extension negative” were the most enriched processes. In the liver, most enriched processes were related to mitochondria (“proton triphosphate gsea”, “electron transport cytochrome”, and “mitochondrial translational elongation”) followed by lipid metabolism-related processes (“oxidation fatty acyl”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “positive lipid process”) ( Figure S1 A, Related to Figure 1 ). Similarly, lipid metabolism-related pathways were also the most enriched reported by KEGG pathways over representation analysis in the liver ( Figure S1 B, Related to Figure 1 ). Figure 1.

FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Among the 24,961 transcripts identified in the liver samples and the 22,657 transcripts in the identified quadriceps sample, the most enriched gene ontology biological processes altered by spaceflight assessed by GSEA commonly shared were related to lipid metabolism ( Figure 1 A). “β-oxidation lipid”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “triglycerides neutral biosynthetic” genesets were upregulated in both organs, while “cholesterol alcohol biosynthetic” and “fatty acyl coa” displayed opposed expression patterns between the two organs. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondria-related process genesets were also among the most shared processes and were upregulated in the liver, while downregulated in the quadriceps. Endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome-related process genesets were also among the most shared process genesets, potentially suggesting impaired protein metabolism. Both positively (upregulated) and negatively (downregulated) enriched KEGG pathways obtained by GSEA for each organ were compared together in a Venn diagram ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Among the 70 pathways analyzed, 11 pathways were common to the two organs. Again, lipid metabolism-related pathways were the most represented among the common ones ( Figure 1 B), with “KEGG_BIOSYNTHESIS_OF_UNSATURED_FATTY_ACIDs” and the two short chain fatty acid metabolism pathways “KEGG_BUTANOATE_METABOLISM” and “KEGG_PROPANOATE_METABOLISM” ( Figure 1 C). Protein metabolism (“KEGG_RIBOSOME”, “KEGG_PROTEASOME”, “KEGG_RNA_POLYMERASE”) and DNA repair-related pathways were also among the common downregulated pathways between the two organs. Thus, spaceflights induce a strong transcriptional response of the metabolism, especially for lipid metabolism in the liver and in the quadriceps. Hypoglycemic signaling pathways genes are the most significantly downregulated in mice quadriceps during spaceflight In the quadriceps, 972 genes were significantly differentially expressed, among which 562 were downregulated and 410 were upregulated. KEGG pathways over representation analysis (ORA) in the online software Webgesalt reported 30 most enriched pathways ( Figure 2 A). Pathways involved in metabolism are particularly enriched, especially those regulating glycemia: HIF1, ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice ( Figure 2 B). Interestingly, glucose transport processes were among the most negatively enriched in GSEA reports, and glucose transport process gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice ( Figures 2 C and 2D).

DEG: Differentially Expressed Genes, FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, ORA: Over Representation Analysis, sPLS-DA: sparse Partial Least Square- Differential Analysis. We investigated the relationships between the downregulation of glucose transport process genes and the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathway genes using the supervised method sPLS-DA (sparse partial least square-differential analysis) with the R-mixOmics package. We compared the reported genes by the sPLS-DA performed at 100% (22657), 75% (16992), 50% (11328), and 25% (5664) (according to the process suggested in Duruflé et al., 2021 ) transcript input in a Venn diagram, and we found that 3463 genes were commonly reported with the strongest importance for discrimination (“discriminating genes”) ( Figure S2 A, Related to Figure 2 ). KEGG pathways ORA on these specific genes reported several enriched pathways among which were the previously mentioned hypoglycemic signaling pathways. Moreover, 491 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) were still present among the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes, and KEGG pathway ORA on these genes demonstrated fewer enriched pathways than on the original analysis of the 972 DEG ( Figure 2 A) and on the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes ( Figure S2 A, Related to Figure 2 ), but the hypoglycemic ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and HIF-1 signaling pathways were still among the most enriched ( Figure S2 B, Related to Figure 2 ). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that inflight mice and ground control mice groups were clearly discriminated by gene variability ( Figure S2 C, Related to Figure 2 ), despite PCA being an unsupervised method. Finally, we found that glucose transport process and hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression correlate ( Figure 2 E), and this correlation is strong as indicated by the correlation intensity level shown on the correlation heatmap ( Figure S2 D, Related to Figure 2 ). Muscle glucose transport gene expression correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation processes gene expression In the quadriceps, DNA repair, autophagy, and translation are among the most enriched processes and pathways reported by GSEA and ORA. DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process genes are decreased in inflight mice compared to ground control mice ( Figures 3 A–3C). Muscle glucose transport gene expression strongly correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process gene expression as shown by the correlation circle plot ( Figures 3 D–3F) and the correlation heatmap ( Figures 3 G–3I). These processes are both high energy demand processes. Thus, decreased energy intake gene expression correlated with an energy-saving transcriptome in mice quadriceps during spaceflight. Figure 3.

Lipid metabolic processes gene expression in the liver correlates with gene expression changes in the muscle and muscle atrophy phenotype Lipid metabolism pathways are among the most reported by GSEA and ORA ( Figures 1 and S1 ). In addition, discriminating genes after 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA and post DEG 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA still maintain this pattern as shown by KEGG ORA ( Figures S3 A and S3B, Related to Figure 4 ). Of note, the two short chain fatty acid “butanoate” and ‘propanoate” were always among the most enriched KEGG pathways ( Figure S3 C, Related to Figure 4 ). Since fatty liver diseases are associated with IR and diabetes, we investigated whether altered glucose transport gene expression was linked to liver lipid metabolism. We found that glucose transport process gene expression strongly correlated with liver lipid metabolism gene expression during spaceflight ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression also correlated with muscle autophagy, DNA repair, and translation process gene expression ( Figures 5 A–5C). Furthermore, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression ( Figure 5 D). Indeed, liver lipid metabolism and muscle atrophy genes formed a gene correlation network ( Figure 5 E). Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1 formed a gene cluster strongly correlating with muscle gene expression ( Figure 5 F). Figure 4.

    "Conclusion": "Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceflight, it is a fact that humans have become a space-faring species. Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies. The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceflight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceflight-induced physiological changes ( da Silveira et al., 2020 ). Mitochondria are complex organelles inside the cell where fundamental biomolecules are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and coupled to energy production by the electron transport chain. Thus, mitochondria play a key role in metabolism and energy management. Here, we found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome in mice during spaceflight. Impaired lipid metabolism and fatty acid accumulation is associated with muscle atrophy. Of note, butanoate and propanoate metabolism were the most affected in the two organs analyzed, decreased in the liver while increased in the muscle. Butanoate and propanoate, also known as butyrate and propionate, are short chain fatty acids produced in the intestinal lumen by bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, especially resistant starch, dietary fiber, and to a lesser extent proteins. Resistant starch is found in some grains, beans, and legumes. The gut microbiome is disturbed during spaceflight; astronauts’ gut microbiome showed an alteration in the composition pattern of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut ( Venegas et al., 2019 ), with the presence of different genus increasing or decreasing during spaceflight but also showing a consistent decrease in bacteria from the taxa Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia, also known to produce butyrate in the intestine ( Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019 ; Voorhies et al., 2019 ; Venegas et al., 2019 ). Microbiome analysis from RR1 mice showed an overall increase of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, but the authors linked that to similar alterations that occur with aging ( Jiang et al., 2019 ). This Firmicute increase in older mice is seen as a sign of dysbiosis and this alteration was shown to be followed by a ∼70% decrease in butyrate levels ( Spychala et al., 2018 ). The upregulation of butyrate and propionate pathways in the muscle can reflect a possible need for these fatty acids and derivatives. In this context, dietary changes could represent a feasible countermeasure to spaceflight-induced physiological changes. The TCA cycle activity and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ratio are decreased in muscle during spaceflight suggesting disturbed energy production. Consistently, we found that spaceflight induced a hyperglycemic response in mouse muscle involving the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor (HIF, ErbB, AMPK, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt). This signaling response mostly affected glucose import gene expression. In addition, high energy demand processes such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation gene expression were decreased in inflight mice quadriceps, suggesting a shift toward an energy-saving mode in the muscle during spaceflight. The muscle is a high energy demand organ. Since the muscle represent up to 50% of the total body mass, its metabolism radically affects glucose availability in the body. Consequently, glucose sparing and energy saving by the muscle in detrimental conditions can compensate for the energy needs of other such as the brain that requires stable and continuous glucose supply. Oxidative stress and DNA damage overload, that can impair mitochondrial function and the metabolism, are examples of detrimental conditions occurring during spaceflight ( Afshinnekoo et al., 2020 ; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019 ). Also, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to muscle atrophy ( Abrigo et al., 2019 ). The HIF-1 signaling enriched pathways suggest that oxidative stress occurred in RR1 inflight mice. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote insulin resistance and diabetes ( Bashan et al., 2009 ; Di Meo et al., 2017 ; Sivitz and Yorek, 2010 ). Our results, in line with previous space studies, suggest an insulin resistance phenotype. Meanwhile, insulin resistance has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism to spare glucose that can benefit survival in various states such as starvation, immune activation growth, and cancer ( Soeters and Soeters, 2012 ). Insulin resistance and diabetes are often associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver diseases. Fatty acids inhibit the insulin signaling pathways by directly interfering in the signaling through diacylglycerol or by overloading the TCA with the precursor acetyl CoA ( Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005 ; Perry et al., 2014 ; Zhang et al., 2010 ). During spaceflight, liver lipid metabolic gene expression correlated with muscle glucose import gene expression in RR1 mice. Insulin resistance, NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis are associated with muscle atrophy and their severity correlates positively ( Chakravarthy et al., 2020 ; Meyer et al., 2020 ; Samuel and Shulman, 2012 ). During a stress starvation, fatty acids together with ketone bodies become the primary source of energy for cells while peripheral organs such as the muscle, but also the skin and bones, provide amino acids taken up by central organs such as the liver, the spleen, immune cells, and healing tissues, ultimately leading to protein loss ( Soeters and Soeters, 2012 ). During a spaceflight, all cells are exposed to space stressors such as radiation, endocrine system perturbation induced by altered circadian rhythm or psychological issues, and microgravity, all promoting oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, it has been shown that spaceflight induces a shift from slow aerobic and highly enriched mitochondria muscle fibers (“slow fiber”, “type I”) toward fast anaerobic and fast low-enriched mitochondria muscle fiber (“fast fiber”, “type II”) ( Gambara et al., 2017b ; Ulanova et al., 2015 ). Mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species. As such, spaceflight-induced fiber shift and mitochondrial dysfunction can be seen as a biological mechanism to decrease mitochondrial activity and mitigate oxidative stress. If mitochondrial stress is a central biological hub during spaceflight, and if the mitochondria are the master organelle of metabolism regulation and energy management, we can then expect a general metabolic shift in the body toward a starvation-like phenotype that promotes decreased mitochondrial activity, decreased metabolism and protein loss in the muscle, and increased lipid metabolism in the liver, to the benefit of all body cells during spaceflight. Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle DNA repair, autophagy, translation, and finally muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression. Butanoate and propanoate metabolism-related genes were still among the one with the strongest correlation. Interestingly, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation improve mitochondrial function, fat accumulation, insulin resistance, diabetes, and liver diseases ( Gao et al., 2009 ; Khan and Jena, 2016 ; Mollica et al., 2017 ; Ye et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ; Zhou et al., 2018 ). Moreover, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation decreased muscle atrophy in various conditions ( Chang et al., 2001 ; Tang et al., 2022 ; Walsh et al., 2015 ). Thus, butyrate supplementation or dietary modification to stimulate microbial production represents simple options to counteract muscle atrophy while preventing insulin resistance and lipid accumulation during spaceflight. Gambara et al. previously identified insulin- and glucose metabolism-linked transcripts as main DEG in BION-M1 biosatellite flown mice longissimus dorsi . In the present study, 17 and 13 differentially expressed genes in the liver and the muscle, respectively, were common to the 89 previously identified ( Gambara et al., 2017a ). Acas1a, Cpt2, Agt, Lcn2, and Prkcd , which were among the most DEG in Gambara’s study were not found significantly differentially expressed neither in the liver nor the quadriceps in the present study. The present study is based on the analyses of discriminating genes identified by the spls-DA performed with the mixOmics script. This method is designed to identify variations that are correlated, here gene expression in the liver and gene expression in the quadriceps. Also, 31 over the 9753, among which Agt and Cpt2, and 24 over the 3463 discriminating genes in the liver and the quadriceps, respectively, were in common with the 89 of the Gambara’s study. These differences may reflect the variability of gene expression between the different muscle types. Nonetheless, in line with the literature, both converge to an altered insulin transcriptome, thus highlighting a general adaptive response in muscle during spaceflight despite different molecular pathways. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of discriminating genes over DEG in deciphering omic data. We found that discriminating genes are mainly linked to lipid metabolism in the liver and insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the quadriceps. This means that lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver correlates with insulin signaling and glucose metabolism gene expression in the quadriceps in mice during spaceflight. We identified a cluster of lipid metabolism processes-related genes in the liver, including Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1, correlating the most with glucose transport gene expression and potentially insulin resistance in the muscle. Among these genes, some are already described for their insulin sensitivity. Fabp2, Abcg5, and Abcg8 genes polymorphisms are associated with insulin sensitivity while Apom might protect against insulin resistance ( Gylling et al., 2004 ; Kurano et al., 2020 ; Weiss et al., 2002 ; Yu et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, Sestrin 1 ( Sesn1 ), a well-known regulator of cell metabolism upregulated in longissimus dorsi of BION-M1 mice, was reported as a discriminating gene in both the liver and the quadriceps ( Gambara et al., 2017a ) . Sestrin proteins are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and insulin signaling ( Lee et al., 2013 ). Sesn1 together with the present lipid metabolism-related gene cluster may thus account in insulin resistance research. The liver influence on quadriceps gene expression we identified needs to be carried out by organ communication mechanisms and we identified hepatokines as the most likely effector. Hepatokines are proteins secreted by the liver that can modulate signaling pathways associated with energy metabolism in the muscle and influence the development of chronic metabolic diseases ( Seo et al., 2021 ). Important for our context, an increased blood concentration of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin increases insulin sensitivity, muscle hypertrophy, and mitochondrial function and diminishes fat mass in the muscle ( Seo et al., 2021 ). Interestingly, increased concentration of Fetuin-A showed to have the inverse effect of the previously described hepatokines ( Jensen-Cody and Potthoff, 2021 ; Seo et al., 2021 ). The levels of Fetuin-A increase after 60 day of bed rest, a ground model for microgravity effects, and we found in the literature a positive correlation between the Fetuin-A levels and the gene expression of Serpina6 and Rdh7, two genes we identified in our gene cluster ( Herrmann et al., 2020 ; Thakur et al., 2008 ; Ward et al., 2020 ). Interestingly, Fetuin-A, as well as FGF21 and ANGPTL4 genes are among the correlating genes in the liver of mice during spaceflight reported by the liver versus quadriceps sPLS-DA. We hypothesize that the gene expression correlation identified in our work likely involves an increased Fetuin-A production by the liver and a diminished production of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin. In conclusion, we described for the first time a strong correlation between liver lipid metabolism gene expression and the downregulation of hypoglycemic and energy demand process-related genes. In the light of current knowledge, our result suggests that a starvation-like phenotype could promote a metabolic shift toward an energy-saving mode, resource sparring, and lipid mobilization through a tight liver-muscle crosstalk contributing to muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Dietary changes based on starch supplementation and microbiome modulation represent an affordable and sustainable countermeasure to support our planetary goals and outer space settlement. Meanwhile, improving food habits and body energy monitoring is an overall human challenge both on Earth and beyond. Limitations of the study Sample size was only six mice to match sample availability in the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome. Future space studies should be designed to match individuals for any factors (organs, environmental parameters, psychological parameters, etc.). Here, we studied biological processes and pathways at a transcriptional level. Transcription regulation, post-transcriptional stabilization, and post-translational modifications impact cell response from gene expression to the final protein activity. In addition, transcriptomics provides a static view of one single moment in the cell. However, spatial repartition also impacts molecular dynamics, and a transcriptional ecosystem theory has been defined ( Silveira and Bilodeau, 2018 ). To further understand the biological significance of the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in mice quadriceps, both functional analysis and multi-omics studies are needed. Additional factors account for inducing muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Circadian rhythm pathways genes are among those enriched in both the quadriceps and the liver in mice during spaceflight ( Figure S1 B, Related to Figures 1 and 2 A), and circadian rhythm perturbation is associated with muscle atrophy ( Choi et al., 2020 ). Astronauts experience continuous circadian rhythm stressors on board the ISS, with sixteen sunsets per day and sustained artificial light exposure as the only illumination source. However, assessing and deciphering circadian rhythm dynamics and correlation at molecular levels require proper protocol and experimental design (Zeitgeber time method) that should be implemented in future space biology research. We used the method implemented in mixOmics between the same molecular variables. This method is a powerful tool to compare any types of datasets. In this context, multiple variables comparisons, e.g., temperature variation inside the spacecrafts, food intake levels, dietary type, cognitive performances, psychological parameters, and allowing multiscale comparisons, will considerably widen our understanding of spaceflight’s impact on living organisms. The list of possible datasets combinations is infinite, as much as the number of studies which can raise from.",
