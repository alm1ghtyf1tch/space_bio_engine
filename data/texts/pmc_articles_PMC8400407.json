    "Abstract": "Abstract There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose ( p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.

    "Results": "3.1. Apoptotic Damage in the Retina Quantitative assessment with TUNEL assay indicated that the density of apoptotic cells in the retinal nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer (GCL) was significantly increased ( p < 0.05) in the irradiated groups by roughly 65% compared to that in the control group ( Figure 1 A). The number of TUNEL positive cells was also calculated in the ONH region ( Figure 1 B). A significant increase of apoptosis in retinal cells was detected in the fractionated group by 50–67% compared to radiation with a single dose and sham controls, respectively ( p < 0.05). Figure 1.

Oxidative Damage Biomarker Using 4-HNE Immunofluorescence staining for an oxidative damage marker was performed using an antibody against 4-HNE specific for lipid peroxidation. A significant increase in immunoreactivity of HNE was seen in the retina ( Figure 2 A) of the mice that received a single dose compared to sham controls ( p < 0.05). A strong trend increases ( p = 0.06) in the fractionated dose group was also documented compared to controls ( Figure 2 B). In ONH ( Figure 2 C), the level of anti-HNE antibody protein in irradiated groups was significantly higher than controls. The immunoreactivity of HNE was more pronounced in the acute single dose group compared to the fractionated mouse group ( Figure 2 D). Figure 2.

Alteration of BRB Integrity Using Water Channel Protein AQP4, Adhesion Molecule PECAM-1, and Tight Junction Protein ZO-1 AQP4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet, which plays an important role in regulating of water permeability. No significant differences in protein expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker for astrocyte activation, was noted between groups. However, increased AQP-4 staining was seen in the irradiated groups compared with controls in the retina ( Figure 3 A). The difference in AQP-4 expression was greater in the irradiated retina of an acute single dose ( p < 0.05) than that of fractionated one ( p = 0.07) ( Figure 3 B). Low levels of AQP-4 expression were detected in the ONH region for all groups with no significant difference between groups (data not shown). Figure 3.

Tight junction proteins and cell adhesion molecules play important role in regulating BRB integrity. Protein expression of PECAM-1 and ZO-1 was evaluated in the retina and ONH region. In the control retinal tissue, only some positive cells for PECAM-1 were found. In the irradiated retina from both single and fractionated dose groups, enhanced immunoreactivity of PECAM-1 cells was apparent in the retinal inner nuclear layer (INL) and GCL ( Figure 4 A). Irradiated groups (single or fractionated doses) showed a significant increase of PECAM immunoreactivity compared to sham control in the retina ( p < 0.05) ( Figure 4 B) and in the ONH region ( Figure 4 C). In the control retinal tissue, positive ZO-1 staining was apparent in the retinal INL and GCL. Only a few positive cells were found in the retina from irradiated mice ( Figure 5 A). Decreased ZO-1 expression was detected in the retina for both single and fractioned dose groups compared to controls ( p < 0.05) ( Figure 5 B). However, positive staining for ZO-1 immunoreactivity, as observed in the retina of the control group, was not detected in the ONH region among all groups (data not shown). Figure 4.

    "Conclusion": "This study demonstrated that 0.5 Gy of proton radiation induced significant changes in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and BRB integrity biomarkers in the mouse retina four months after a dose of 0.5 Gy. There were differential responses between single and fractionated dose schedules in several parameters. Differences related to BRB biomarker distribution were observed between the retina and ONH ( Table 1 ). Table 1. Summary of Biomarker Expressions in The Retina and Optic Nerve Head (ONH).

Radiation increases the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 10 ]. Free radicals initiate a variety of cellular signaling and alter biomarkers that lead to cellular damage. 4-HNE is considered an oxidative stress biomarker for lipid peroxidation [ 11 ]. Studies suggest that HNE plays an important role in stress-mediated signaling for cellular damage and in the mechanisms of apoptosis caused by these stress factors [ 12 ]. Our observations show increased 4-HNE staining indicative of oxidative damage to the retina and optic nerve after proton radiation exposure compared to controls. The findings were consistent with previous findings in many research models [ 11 , 13 ]. Radiation delivered in fractionation over 25 days showed a smaller level of HNE expression than that of a single dose in the retina and ONH. However, single- and fractionated-dose schedules appear to produce a similar level of apoptosis in the retina, while fractionated dose schedules showed a higher number of apoptotic cell damage in the ONH region. It is the general consensus that for radiotherapy, and for patients who receive high total doses, a hyperfractionated dose produces less damage to normal tissue by permitting dose recovery for damage repair to DNA and other proteins [ 14 ]. However, our retina apoptosis data did not indicate that there was substantial repair of injury or dose recovery at a late observation time point of four months, although the total doses that were delivered to the mouse were much lower than the dose delivered to the patients in the radiotherapy. Our previous study also showed that there were no significant differences in retinal endothelial cell density following single or split dose with two equal dose fractions of 8–28 Gy [ 15 ]. Evaluation of DNA repair of double-strand breaks in the rabbit retina, confirms that little DNA repair for dose recovery was found in the aged rabbit retinas [ 16 , 17 ], although retinal radiosensitivity of mice may be different compared to that of rats or rabbits. Surprisingly, a higher number of TUNEL positive cells were detected in the fractionated dose group compared to that of acute single dose exposure in the ONH region. One possible explanation is that acute radiation-induced apoptosis in the ONH may precede fractionated doses-induced apoptosis. By four months, the level of apoptotic damage already passes its peak in the retina that received single dose of 0.5 Gy, so it is less pronounced in acute irradiated group than that of fractionated dose group at four months. However, the complex regional difference in response to single and hyperfractionated dose schedule warrant further investigation. The difference in structure, cellular composition, and permeability or BRB property may contribute to the capacity of the tissue to regulate radiation response in the retina and ONH. In the present study, we found that low-dose proton radiation induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. AQP-4, a water channel protein, has an important role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet [ 18 ]. The upregulation of AQP-4 in irradiated retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential disruption of barrier integrity and even possible edema formation. PECAM-1 is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes that can be highly induced in response to inflammatory situations, leading to secretion of chemokines and cytokines [ 19 ]. PECAM-1 serves as an adhesion-signaling molecule with important roles in inflammation and leukocyte transmigration [ 20 ]. It functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to modulate endothelial cell junctional integrity [ 21 ] and may serve as a primary coordinator of many signaling pathways involved in cell metabolism and protein expression [ 22 ]. Increased expression of PECAM-1 has also been shown to lead to disruption of BRB integrity after retinal vascular injury [ 23 ]. Leukocyte migration from the blood into the retinal tissue promotes the breakdown of the BRB [ 24 ]. The higher PECAM-1 expression in the retina following radiation exposure observed in our study may facilitate inflammatory cells to cross the BRB due to changes in the BRB permeability [ 25 ]. The integrity of the BRB is also dependent on tight junctions (TJs). Tight junctions are transmembrane proteins and peripheral cytoplasmic proteins. ZO-1 is peripheral cytoplasmic protein and is critical in the initial formation, distinct organization, and function of TJs [ 26 , 27 ]. Many studies have shown that vascular permeability is altered by decreasing the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1 [ 28 ]. Our previous spaceflight study also showed decreased immunoreactivity of ZO-1 expression in the retina of the flight group compared to the ground controls [ 29 ]. Targeted irradiation of mice caused corneal endothelial cell loss, reduction of ZO-1 junctional contacts, and induction of corneal edema [ 30 ]. The degradation of TJ-associated proteins in the retina following injury has been also shown to lead to BRB breakdown [ 18 ]. In the current study, the decrease in ZO-1 protein expression in the retina together with the increase in water channel protein AQP-4 and adhesion molecules PECAM-1, in conjunction with increased apoptosis, suggests the BRB disturbance and prolonged tissue remodeling due to radiation exposure with single or fractionated dose schedules. More recently, ONH has become one of the focuses in the research surrounding SANS [ 7 ]. Edema was observed in the prelaminar ONH in astronauts [ 31 ]. These data points to the hypothesis that multiple factors, including fluid shifts, may lead to ONH swelling and associated intraocular alterations [ 32 , 33 ]. Previous human and monkey studies showed that prelaminar ONH has distinct BRB properties when compared to the retina. Microvessels in the prelaminar region of the ONH lack blood-brain barrier (BBB) proteins and display nonspecific permeability, while the retina has BBB characteristic proteins but lacks permeability biomarkers [ 34 ]. Some of our results are in agreement with their findings. In our mouse study, we found that radiation exposure induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity and function, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. The staining pattern in the ONH differs from that of the retina. Low level positive staining for BRB biomarkers including water channel protein, AQP-4 and TJ protein, ZO-1 in ONH region indicates deficient BRB function, although adhesion molecule, PECAM-1 was present in the ONH. PECAM-1 also plays an important role in mediating trans-endothelial immune cell migration [ 35 ] and participates in key inflammatory events [ 25 ]. Lack of BRB biomarkers in the ONH may reflect dysregulation of barrier function and vessel integrity that can cause chronic inflammation, rendering more susceptible of this region to environmental insults and pathology of ONH diseases. Further studies are needed to investigate vascular permeability as well as lymphatic and glymphatic clearance related to the accumulation of fluid in the ONH region [ 36 ]. In conclusion, we hope that our investigation sheds light on the mechanism of space radiation-induced ocular response. Knowledge gained from this study could aid further approaches toward more effective countermeasures during human space travel. Our long-term goal is to use system biology approach to investigate the association between ophthalmic changes and other organs pathologies in response to ionizing radiation and to facilitate a better understanding of space radiation-induced tissues response and its relationship to health implication that may lead to disease development.",
