    "Results": "3.1. NSCs in Space Environment (SPC) Preserve Their “Stemness” and Proliferate This experiment was designed to ascertain the proliferation of NSCs solely while in microgravity. In order to elucidate if NSCs in “space microgravity” proliferate, we used the Type IV automated experiment insert from Kiwi (Airbus, Friedrichshafen, DE), allowing for a fresh medium change twice during space travel. The medium within which the cells traveled was replaced with fresh medium containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) two days after the cargo berth to the ISS. Therefore, BrdU incorporation took place during three days. NSC cultures were then arrested with the second stem cell medium and placed at 4 °C for further examination upon return to the laboratory ( Scheme 1 ). Scheme 1. Open in a new tab Timeline 1: This diagram illustrates the times at which culture media changes took place while neural stem cells (NSCs) traveled and were in space in the automated hardware at 37 °C. Culture medium from Tank 1 containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was released into the cell chamber 2 days after docking. Three days later (at 5 days of having been in space), the second medium without BrdU was released and the units were stored at 4 °C. Proliferation while in space was ascertained during only 3 days. NSCs were seeded onto a mesh-cell carrier because cells adhere firmly to it and have a better resistance to vibrations and g-forces during take-off and re-entry to the atmosphere. This protocol was tested and verified during the science definition phase of the investigation following NASA’s requirements ( Figure 1A ). Figure 1. Open in a new tab ( A ) View of an automated Type IV Unit Kiwi (Airbus). ( B ) Tank 1 (green) contained NSCs, medium, and BrdU. At time (T) + 2 this medium was delivered to NSCs, at T + 5 medium from the second tank (blue) was delivered to arrest the cells and the units were placed at 4 °C. Two units containing 12 pieces of mesh carrier with cells were used for the “in space” proliferation study ( C ) Representative view of the mesh carrier on which tire NSCs were seeded.

Upon return, the NSCs were recovered and post-fixed to perform triple immunofluorescence against two NSC markers as previously described [ 6 ]—polysialic acid (PSA) cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), known as PSA-NCAM, and the intermediate filament protein nestin, also known as a neural stem/progenitor cell marker—as well as BrdU for the detection of new DNA as a marker for cell proliferation ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Human NSCs proliferate in space. Open in a new tab Triple immunofluorescence performed on cells adhered to the mesh-cell carrier. A to D show NSCs that proliferated while in space. E to H show views of ground control NSCs. ( A ) The PSA-NCAM antibody labeled most but not all cells. ( B ) Cells expressing nestin as seen by the intensity of the marker in all NSCs. ( C ) Different intensities of BrdU-labeled cells, some organized in rows (arrowheads) or as dividing cells (arrows) as shown in the insets. ( D ) Most cells expressed BrdU and nestin and a subpopulation colocalized with PSA-NCAM. ( E ) PSA-NCAM was not expressed by the NSCr grown in 1 G (ground control). ( F ) Some cells expressed nestin at different intensities and others were negative. ( G ) Only some cells intensely expressed BrdU (arrowheads), while most had a faint expression (open arrowheads) or were negative. ( H ) The merged image shows that there were less cells in 1 G (ground controls) with respect to the cells sent to space. The BrdU incubation was for 72 h for all cells in automated units. (Bar = 50 μm). 3.2. Passive Experiments In order to ascertain the health status of the NSCs, we performed experiments using 8-well Petri dishes from Kiwi (Airbus). We have called these passive experiments, because tire cells remained within the same culture medium for 45 days (counting from handover to handover), having spent a total of 39.3 days in space from launch to splashdown of the dragon vehicle and the rest of the time in transit. Upon return, the cells were harvested from the hardware and seeded on poly-d-lysine. After the recovery period, the NSCs were seeded in Seahorse Bioscience XFplates (Agilent) to assess their cellular bioenergetic status. Tire oxygen consumption rare (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, a measure of glycolysis) were both higher in the NSCs exposed to the space environment as compared to the ground control cells, indicating a higher metabolic state ( Figure 3 ). These measurements were performed one week after the NSCs returned to Earth. Therefore, one can infer that NSCs “remember” having been in microgravity. Alternatively, re-adaptation to 1 G may have prompted higher energetic needs. Figure 3. Open in a new tab SPC-NSCs and ground control NSCs were recovered from the passive hardware ( A ) and treated in the same manner. ( B ) Representative example of past-flight NSCs that continued to actively proliferate, as shown by the arrows. ( C ) After 39.3 days in space, NSCs display enhanced energy consumption.

The values are expressed as mean + SD. * The Student’s t test revealed that these differences were significant (p < 0.05). 3.3. Fate Choice After the recovery period, the NSCs were fed with neuronal specification medium (NSM) [ 6 ] in order to obtain neurons. Exposure to a space environment did not alter the NSCs potential to choose the neuronal fate. Interestingly, neuroblasts proliferated for more than 1 week after being in NSM before moving toward maturation. The timeline for neuronal specification is shown in Scheme 2 . Scheme 2. Open in a new tab Timeline 2. Neuronal Specification. Upon their return to Earth, the cells were allowed to recover in NSC medium and standard conditions for 9 days. NSCs were introduced to neuronal specification medium (NSM) on Day 10. After 10 or 14 days of having been in NSM, we examined the electrophysiological properties of these cells. Electrophysiological recordings of SPC-NSC-derived neurons were obtained 10 days or 14 days after being in NSM using standard procedures, as detailed in our previous publication [ 8 ] Figure 4 . Figure 4. SPC-NSCs gave rise to neurons after space flight. Open in a new tab ( A )—(left panels) Whole-cell voltage clamp recording; using; K-gluconate in the internal solution: (top) step voltage commands from −80 to +10 mV elicited only minimal inward currents, whereas outward currents were predominant, and (bottom) graph represents an IV relationship, illustrating the presence of large outward currents starting at −30 mV. ( B ) When the recording was switched to current clamp mode, small step current pulses evoked large negative voltage deflections and only an incipient action potential with depolarizing current injections, demonstrating a neuronal phenotype, yet still very immature. ( C ) Infrared video-microscopy images of human neurons derived from NSCs flown into space. The top left panel shows a cluster of cells with multiple processes emanating from different cells. The top right panel shows an NSC with bipolar morphology. The bottom left panel shows the same cell after patch and electrophysiological recordings (illustrated in A and B) were obtained. The bottom right panel shows another NSC after patching. A total of seven plates containing SPC-NSCs were used, and 16 cells were recorded in voltage and current clamp modes using a K-gluconate-based internal solution. First, passive membrane properties were determined in the voltage clamp mode. The cell membrane capacitance was relatively small (27.3 ± 1.9 pF, mean ± SEM), while the input resistance was high (553.4 ± 84.7 MΩ). The decay time constant was very fast (0.4 ± 0.05 ms). These properties are similar to those obtained from implanted NSCs [ 8 ]. After measuring passive membrane properties, the recording was switched to the current clamp mode. The mean resting membrane potential was relatively depolarized (−38.1 ± 1.8 mV), and upon injection of depolarizing current steps, most cells displayed a small-amplitude action potential, suggesting that these SPC-NSCs were in an immature state. In the gap free mode, we determined that spontaneous synaptic activity was not yet apparent.",
    "Conclusion": "Here we have demonstrated that human NSCs proliferate while in space and that they remain as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended, in the same culture medium, and in space microgravity. Moreover, these cells also keep their ability to become young neurons in the appropriate conditions. Silvano’s team reported data supporting that simulated microgravity arrests cell proliferation, albeit in a transient manner, and they also found that these changes were not permanent as NSCs recovered their proliferative capacity when they were returned to normal gravity. The apparent contradiction between Silvano’s group reporting the arrest of proliferation date and this study may reside in the fact that the cells they used were from a different species (i.e., mouse vs. human). Additionally, their cells were kept in simulated microgravity far 3 to 5 days, as opposed to our NSCs, which were exposed to SPC microgravity tor 5 days at 37 °C and in BrdU for 3 days. Therefore, the reasons for the apparent contradiction may be due to the following: (1) the extent of the exposure to microgravity, which might be a determinant for the arrest of cell proliferation in Silvano’s study or (2) perhaps simulated microgravity differs from space microgravity with respect to the regulation of neural cells and their biological processes. Why a higher bioenergetic state is elicited by microgravity is not clear at the present time. The fact that we demonstrated that NSCs proliferate in space needs to be studied in more detail, as it might be that this phenomenon contributes to the visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP) exhibited by astronauts in space and upon their return to Earth [ 9 ]. Elucidating the origin of the increased energy needs by brain cells is crucial in order to design effective countermeasures for astronauts working onboard the International Space Station and for long-term space travel. Moreover, here we found that NSCs displayed an elevated energy metabolism; both oxygen consumption and glycolysis were higher than in the ground control counterparts, confirming our previous findings from work using “simulated microgravity”[ 10 ]. We have previously reported that simulated microgravity enhances mitochondrial function in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the CNS [ 11 ]. Two of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production, glucose and pyruvate, were decreased after just 3 days in microgravity, while lactate levels increased considerably indicating that OLs switched to anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet the energy demands elicited by microgravity [ 11 ]. It is possible that NSCs in space require more energy for proliferation as well as for maintaining homeostasis in an environment where, besides microgravity, there are other factors involved, such as radiation, moving while being packed and unpacked, and variation of g-forces occurring during launching and splashdown. Nonetheless, the cells appeared to be able to recover from such a journey and display their stemness when returned to Earth. Furthermore, as mentioned above, their membrane properties were similar to the NSCs grown in normal gravity.",
