    "Abstract": "Nutritional factors are associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, yet mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men ...",
    "Results": "Among 69 men (22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to fish, and 26 to placebo), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in IGF - 1 expression level between the placebo and lycopene arms ( p = 0.93) nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and fish arms ( p = 0.99).",
    "Conclusion": "Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil did not significantly change IGF - 1 and COX - 2 gene expression in the normal prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression profiles may shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutrients in prostate cancer.",
