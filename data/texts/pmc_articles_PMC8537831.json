    "Abstract": "Abstract The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce ( Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, ( Brassica rapa var japonica ); and green leaf lettuce, ( Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.

    "Results": "3.1. Plant Germination and Growth VEG-03D was designed with a mixed horticulture layout of two pillows for each cultivar to examine the interaction of all three crop types ( Figure 2 ). In Veg-03D, we found that the more rapidly growing mizuna plants overshadowed adjacent lettuce plants, causing watering and accessibility issues for plant maintenance. Therefore, for the VEG-03E and F growth tests, the layout was adjusted for easy access, observation, and plant maintenance ( Figure 2 ). The overall emergence rates for mizuna and red romaine lettuce were 91.6% and 83.3%, respectively. Green leaf lettuce seeds averaged 66.6 percent germination (75% in VEG-03D vs. 62.5% in VEG-03E/F) with two stunted seedlings. After thinning, one healthy green leaf lettuce seedling failed to develop further, resulting in only two out of four pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03E and F compared to two out of two pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03D. Except for the two green leaf lettuce plants, all other plants appeared healthy. Tip burn was observed later during the grow-outs in red romaine lettuce plants. In addition, older mizuna leaves also turned yellowish with a dry edge. All these signs occurred after the 30–31-day harvest, and increased with time, especially for mizuna, indicating a possible lack of nutrients with the age of the plant. No signs of disease were found in these plants. Water usage was relatively constant with about one liter consumed per plant per 30 days ( Table S1 ). Mizuna required a slightly higher water volume to maintain hydration and plant health compared to both lettuces. These experiments were performed by the crew in a semi-autonomous manner; the water volume was adequate for maintaining plant health, but may not have been optimal, and may have varied among the crew members who tended these plants. 3.2. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Leaves Aerobic plate counts (APC) of bacteria on leaves from Veg-03D, E, and F harvests of the three leafy greens were in the range of 4.3 × 10 2 (red romaine in VEG-03E) to 3.5 × 10 7 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram (g) of leaf tissue. Average counts on mizuna leaves from both harvests grown in VEG-03D and E were not significantly different from each other, ranging from 1.4 × 10 3 to 2.6 × 10 7 CFU/g. The average counts on green leaf lettuce across experiments D, E, and F were 7.9 × 10 6 , 3.5 × 10 7 , and 5.9 × 10 5 CFU/g, respectively. Only one harvest was completed on the green leaf lettuce plant from E. Red romaine lettuce grown in VEG-03E had lower counts than those harvested from D and F ( p ≤ 0.05). Average bacterial counts from red romaine lettuce leaves from D, E, and F were 6.9 × 10 6 , 5.7 × 10 3 , and 6.1 × 10 6 CFU/g , respectively ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4. Open in a new tab Bacterial counts (CFU on TSA per gram of frozen tissue) on leaves from plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F for three crops. ( A ) mizuna, ( B ) red romaine lettuce, ( C ) green leaf lettuce. Open circles represent counts from the first harvest, closed circles the final harvest. Bars represent the mean and error bars are standard error of the mean. Statistical differences ( p < 0.05) are indicated with an asterisk. Yeast and mold counts from the leaves grown in VEG-03D were lowest on average on mizuna, 2.4 × 10 4 CFU/g followed by 5.1 × 10 6 CFU/g on red romaine lettuce leaves and green leaf lettuce with the highest average counts at 9.8 × 10 9 CFU/g, however the difference between plant types was not significant. The fungal counts were higher on the second harvest leaves from all three plant types grown in VEG-03D ( Figure 5 ). The fan anomaly may have contributed to this trend, which was not found in VEG-03E and F. All screening tests for potential food borne pathogens, E. coli , S. aureus and Salmonella sp. showed negative results. Figure 5.

( A ) mizuna, ( B ) red romaine lettuce, ( C ) green leaf lettuce. Open circles represent counts from the first harvest, closed circles the final harvest. Bars represent the mean and error bars are standard error of the mean. 3.3. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Pillow Components Plant pillows were investigated for bacterial and fungal counts from the wicking material, the roots, and the substrate inside the pillow. Figure 3 illustrates a plant pillow after the plant had been harvested and before sampling including the wicking material ( Figure 3 A) that initially holds the seed and wicks water from the substrate to the germinating seedling, and the substrate and roots after removal from the pillow ( Figure 3 C). Four pillow samples from VEG-03D (2 red romaine, 1 mizuna and 1 green leaf lettuce), 2 from VEG-03E (mizuna) and 2 from VEG-03F (red romaine) were processed for analysis. Bacterial counts on the wicking material and arcillite substrate were not influenced by plant type or Veggie facility (SN 001 or SN 002) used in the tech demo ( Figure 6 A). The wick samples had APC counts ranging from 1.9 × 10 8 to 1.8 × 10 9 CFU/g. Average counts from the substrate samples ( n = 3) ranged from 2.6 × 10 6 to 2.2 × 10 7 CFU/g. CFU/g values on the red romaine lettuce roots grown in VEG-03F were the lowest of the root bacterial counts, 9.3 × 10 6 and 2.6 × 10 7 compared to 3.4 × 10 7 and 7.1 × 10 7 CFU/g from the red romaine lettuce roots grown in VEG-03D. Bacterial counts from mizuna and green leaf lettuce roots were all higher than the red romaine lettuce counts. Two mizuna plant roots grown in VEG-03E yielded 8.7 × 10 7 and 2.5 × 10 8 CFU/g while the mizuna roots grown in VEG-03D had the highest bacterial counts of the mizuna, 2.6 × 10 8 CFU/g. Only one sample of roots from the green leaf lettuce grown in VEG-03D was returned for analysis, yielding 1.3 × 10 8 CFU/g bacteria. Figure 6. Open in a new tab Bacterial ( A ) and fungal ( B ) counts (CFU per gram) on plant pillow components from VEG-03D, E, and F. Bars represent the median. Fungal counts are illustrated in Figure 6 B. The lowest and highest counts on the wicks 4.7 × 10 6 to 2.2 ×10 8 CFU/g were from the 2 red romaine pillows from VEG-03D. Fungal counts were highest in mizuna roots and substrate from the same VEG-03E pillow with the highest bacterial counts, however, the lowest fungal counts were from the VEG-03D pillow that also had similarly high bacterial counts, indicating no correlation. 3.4. Bacterial and Fungal Counts on Surface Samples Swab samples were collected after the harvest was complete but before wiping down of the interior bellows with disinfectant wipes. While each sample site is a different location, distinct sample sites are the same across the three tech demos. Bacteria were recovered and cultivated from all 8 sample sites from VEG-03D, 3 out of 8 samples in VEG-03E and 5 out of 8 in VEG-03F ( Table 2 ). Fungi were recovered from 5, 3, and 7 samples out of 8 from VEG-03D, E, and F, respectively. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen and at least two of the pillow surfaces across all the experiments ( Table 3 ). VEG-03E was run in SN 001 Veggie facility, a unit that was just installed and had not been used before on ISS, had the fewest locations with recovery of bacteria and fungi. VEG-03D and F were run in the same Veggie SN 002 facility, the older Veggie on ISS. Bacterial counts (CFU/swab) on surfaces from VEG-03D ranged from 3.5 × 10 1 on the fan screen to 6.0 × 10 4 on the pillow surface. Several samples from VEG-03E were below the detection limit with the exception of the fan screen and two pillow samples. VEG-03F had the highest CFUs on the pillow surfaces ranging from 1.3 × 10 5 to 4.0 × 10 6 /swab. Fungi from VEG-03D samples ranged from below detection to 4.5 × 10 3 CFU per swab. The highest fungal load, 4.0 × 10 6 CFU/swab was found on samples from VEG-03F on a pillow sample ( Table 2 ). Table 2.

Cultivated Bacteria and Fungi Isolate Identification Cultivation and recovery of the bacteria and fungi present in all samples was dependent on survival during sample storage as well as growth medium and incubation conditions and represents a fraction of the taxa present, however community sequencing verified the presence of each of the cultivated bacterial and fungal genera. A total of 30 bacterial genera were isolated on TSA and identified from VEG-03D, E, and F plant, pillow, and surface samples ( Table 3 ). Several genera were isolated from samples from all three Veggie sample sets including Burkholderia , Chryseobacterium , Leifsonia , Microbacterium , Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus . More genera were recovered and identified from VEG-03D (20) than from E or F, and eight of the 30 isolates were unique to VEG-03D samples ( Table 3 ). The fungi, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium spp. and Rhodotorula spp. where ubiquitous across samples from all three tech demos ( Table 4 ). Exophiala spp. was identified in only one sample from VEG-03E, the substrate, and swab samples from E and F recovered Purpureocillium lilacinum. All fungi, except the Purpureocillium isolated only from swab samples, were verified by community sequencing. Because swab samples yielded no DNA, we were not able to verify the presence of Purpureocillium. An additional 26 genera of fungi were identified in samples using community sequencing of the ITS region ( Table S5 ). Table 4.

Microbial Diversity Alpha and beta diversity represent the variation within and between samples. Alpha diversity of VEG-03D, E, and F, determined by the Shannon Index, ranged between 0.1 (very low) and 2.0 ( Tables S2–S4 ). Arcillite substrate and root tissue had the highest diversity indices followed by the wick, then leaf tissue. Leaf tissue for all plant types had the lowest alpha diversity. Alpha diversity for the swabs taken for the three experiments fell between 0.8 and 1.4. The distribution as determined by the Pielou Evenness Index measurement indicated the genera present were not evenly distributed with values ranging from 0.3 for substrate to 0.1 for leaf tissue. This trend was consistent between all three experiments ( Tables S2–S4 ). Beta diversity as determined between samples with the Bray–Curtis calculation in QIIME 2.0 was conceptualized as PCoA plots ( Figure 7 and Figure 8 A–E). Beta diversity was calculated between all leaf tissues returned from ISS ( Figure 7 and Table S6 ). Just over 50% of the variation between plant types could be explained in the 2 axes of the PCoA ( Figure 7 ). Plants from VEG-03D presented a visual clustering of leaves for all plant types with the exception one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences. The corresponding Adonis statistics provides a permutation statistic of the analysis of variance which provides an R 2 value indicating the % variance explained by each group. The lower the R 2 value the more similar the samples. The R 2 value for all plant types (0.397) indicated that approximately 40% of the variation is derived from the influence of the tech demo ( p = 0.001) versus only 10% (0.101) was due to the plant type. The influence of the plant type was not significant. Figure 7. Open in a new tab PCoA plot represents the plant leaf tissue returned from VEG-03D, E, and F on the ISS. Plant type MM is mizuna mustard, OL is ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce and WG is ‘Waldmann’s Green’ leaf lettuce. Figure 8. Open in a new tab PCoA plots represent the plant and pillow components for VEG-03D, E and F tech demonstrations performed on ISS. ( A ) is VEG-03D mizuna mustard, ( B ) is red romaine lettuce, ( C ) is green lettuce, ( D ) is VEG-03E mizuna mustard and ( E ) is VEG-03F red romaine lettuce. Beta diversity was also compared among the plant types to include the plant leaf and root and the Veggie pillow substrate and wick. Each crop type was considered separately within the three experiments ( Figure 8 ). VEG-03D contained the following: one pillow with mizuna mustard ( Figure 8 A), two pillows with red romaine lettuce ( Figure 8 B) and one pillow with green leaf lettuce ( Figure 8 C). The PCoA of the three plant types with their associated pillow components in VEG-03D captured a high percentage of the variation within a single axis, with 67%, 76%, and 79%, respectively. The PCoAs for VEG-03D indicate that the green leaf lettuce leaf microbiome was more dissimilar from the root, wick, and substrate. However, the root and substrate were similar. Approximately 99% of the variation accounted for within the pillow sample set was due to the sample type itself ( Figure 8 C and Table S6 ). The additional two crops grown in VEG-03D displayed the same trends with root and substrate microbiomes more similar while the plant leaf microbiomes were dissimilar containing a greater amount of variation (97% and 84% for mizuna and red romaine lettuce, respectively) ( Figure 8 and Table S6 ). In all pillow samples, the wick, which did not cluster with root and substrate, appeared to be more variable. The variation captured for the VEG-03E and F experiments was lower than seen in VEG-03D with approximately 40% of the variation explained in the first principle component for VEG-03E ( Figure 8 D) and approximately 50% for VEG-03F ( Figure 8 E). In these two experiments, the wick again appeared to have the greatest variance from other components. Leaf, root, and substrate were more similar. The R 2 values for VEG-03E indicated 63% of the variation was due to the sample type, whereas in VEG-03F, 77% of the variation was attributed to the sample type. All comparisons were significant ( p < 0.05) ( Figure 8 and Table S6 ). 3.7. Community Characterization Community characterization of the pillow components and plant tissue (leaf, root, substrate, and wick) was analyzed at the genus level to determine unique and shared genera ( Figure 9 ). There were few genera common to all four components in each of the three technical demonstrations, (VEG-03D, E, F) and ranged between one and nine genera. VEG-03D green leaf lettuce plant and pillow samples had the highest number of shared genera with nine ( Figure 9 A). In all three tech demos the wick component revealed a high number of unique genera between 2–19; the highest number of unique genera occurring in VEG-03E mizuna mustard pillow wicks ( Figure 9 B). Figure 9. Open in a new tab Venn diagrams revealing unique and shared genera across the 3 tech demos and crop types. ( A ) VEG-03D samples, ( B ) VEG-03E samples, ( C ) VEG-03F samples. Diagrams depict plant and corresponding pillow components (wick, substrate, and root tissue). Numbers are the number of genera with greater than 50 sequencing reads. The % is the percent total reads. Venn diagrams were completed with Venny v 2.1. Figure 9 A illustrates a high number of genera shared between wick, substrate, and root tissue in VEG-03D with 26 in mizuna, 22 and 31 in red romaine lettuce, and 27 in green leaf lettuce. The number of shared genera among VEG-03E components was higher for mizuna mustard at 31 and VEG-03F had 30 shared genera between wick, substrate, and root tissue ( Figure 9 C). Root tissue had few unique genera, but in all crops the root had high numbers of shared genera with substrate (6–28) and between root, substrate, and wick (22–31) which included more than 40% of the genera present ( Figure 9 ). Leaf tissue had a variable number of unique species with VEG-03D having the highest with 11 in red romaine lettuce, followed by 10 in mizuna in VEG-03E. Overall, characterization of genera in the four plant and pillow components revealed few unique species in each of the components but indicated a higher number of shared species especially among root, substrate, and wick ( Figure 9 ). A closer inspection of the top community constituents revealed that variations in the bacterial makeup between pillow sections (wick, substrate, and root) differed from the leaf tissue ( Figure 10 , Figure 11 and Figure 12 ). VEG-03D which included analysis of all three leafy green crops grown yielded several bacterial constituents seen in all plant types ( Figure 10 ). These included Burkholderia , Enterobacter , Erwinia and Pseudomonas . However, there were fewer numbers of genera in leaves than in the root, wick, or substrate, which is not unexpected. There were more similar constituents in the wick, substrate, and root with Burkholderia and Novosphingobium identified in each component for all crops ( Figure 10 , Figure 11 and Figure 12 ). The wick material appeared to present a higher variation in genera than did root or substrate. Figure 10. Open in a new tab VEG-03D technical demonstration. The top 15–17 genera for the Veggie pillows and corresponding plants as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. ( A ) is Mizuna mustard; ( B ) is green lettuce and ( C , D ) are red romaine lettuce.

The most abundant (17) genera for the Veggie pillows and corresponding ‘Outredgeous’ red romaine lettuce leaf tissue grown on the ISS and determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Percent is based upon the abundance of sequencing reads. The VEG-03E samples and pillows returned from ISS were mizuna mustard ( Figure 11 ) while VEG-03F were red romaine lettuce ( Figure 12 ). Again, all samples contained Burkholderia with some samples containing up to 50% of the total abundance of sequencing reads. VEG-03E mizuna mustard pillow substrate and root tissues contained higher levels of Novosphingobium than seen in the VEG-03D tech demo. Staphylococcus was present in mizuna leaf from one VEG-03E pillow accounting for a large percent of the 15 listed and present in small fraction in the wick although was not detectable in the root or substrate. The wick material had a higher level of variability in the bacterial genera detected ( Figure 11 ). The VEG-03F tech demo comparing red romaine lettuce plant and pillow samples showed less variation in the bacterial genera in the wick and leaf compared to VEG-03D and E. Pseudomonas which was prevalent in most wick materials in VEG-03D, E and F could also be detected in leaf tissue ( Figure 10 , Figure 11 and Figure 12 ). Ralstonia, and Pseudomonas were also present in all samples from all three tech demos. ( Figure 10 and Figure 12 ). Several genera were present in VEG-03D ( Figure 10 ) and F ( Figure 12 ) but not in E. The genera Enterobacter , Chitinophaga , Novosphingobium and Bradyrhizobium are a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples. In VEG-03D Methylobacterium was identified in red romaine lettuce and mizuna while Janthinobacterium was identified in red romaine.",
    "Conclusion": "The Veggie plant growth units deployed on the ISS have provided a platform to grow leafy greens for astronaut consumption since 2014. This series of tech demonstrations was the first time that mixed cropping was tested in Veggie, with three leafy greens. Plant growth was successful, however, there may have been an influence on growth based on plant type and position in the Veggie. It was observed in VEG 03-D that the mizuna canopy shaded the adjacent red romaine lettuce plant possibly limiting exposure to light and effecting maintenance. Germination was lower with the green leaf lettuce resulting in fewer and smaller plants. Mixed cropping could also have an impact on the transfer of plant-specific phyllosphere microbiota between crop types [ 14 , 16 , 20 ]. Microbiological food safety of Veggie-grown crops is assured by routine culture-based pathogen screening and bacterial and fungal enumeration on crops grown in ground analogs as well as samples returned from ISS. The bacterial and fungal count data and pathogen screening performed on the plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F indicates from a microbial food safety perspective, the crops are low risk to the crew. With approximately 10% of a microbial community identified with culturable methods, sequencing of both bacterial and fungal constituents provides additional identification of the community microbiota [ 42 ]. These data allow for the identification of the non-culturable microbes including the identification of beneficial microbes and microbes of concern and the confirmation of the negative culture-based screening results for E. coli and Salmonella . Many of the genera isolated and identified from the Veggie plant phyllosphere are present in terrestrially grown leafy greens. Several surveys of leafy greens revealed that Pseudomonas species dominate the phyllosphere. A study done on two types of leafy greens, rocket salad and lettuce, showed that Pseudomonas , was the most abundant genera present, followed by Pantoea , Arthrobacter and Acinetobacter [ 14 ]. In this study, Pseudomonas sp. was identified by culture independent methods on all samples except one mizuna plant in VEG-03E. Burkholderia was identified in all plant samples by culture and culture independent methods. This is in contrast with other surveys of field grown leafy greens where Burkholderia is not a dominant member of the core microbiome [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. However, Burkholderia was found on both ISS grown and ground controls in an earlier study done on Veggie grown red romaine lettuce [ 28 ]. Bacterial counts (CFU/g) from field and hydroponic grown lettuce have been reported in the range of 4 × 10 4 to 2 × 10 8 and fungal counts (CFU/g) between 8 × 10 2 and 2 × 10 6 [ 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 ]. The bacterial and fungal counts on leaves of plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F were in the range of the reported values for farm or market produce counts of similar type. However, when compared to the analysis of red romaine lettuce from previous Veggie tech demos [ 28 ], the bacterial and fungal counts per gram of red romaine lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-03D and F were higher. As with previous ISS grown leafy greens [ 28 , 51 ] an increase in fungal counts was observed in some of the samples with repeated harvests especially in VEG-03D. VEG-03A and VEG-03D were run in the same Veggie facility (SN 002) and during plant growth, in both cases, the humidity was higher than other grow-outs. Humidity is a factor that can influence the microbial density and community in the phyllosphere and the surface of the leaf. It has been demonstrated that higher humidity and leaf wetness increases fungal abundance on plants including fungal plant pathogens [ 29 , 52 , 53 ]. The characterization of the spatial distribution of microbiota on the Veggie facility surfaces, plant growth pillows, and multi-species plant tissues was performed to elucidate possible sources and routes of transfer of microbes around the Veggie facility and plants. Generally, surface sample microbial count data showed low counts on the interior bellows surfaces, and below detection level counts mostly in VEG-03E. After harvest, the bellows are cleaned thoroughly by the crew with disinfectant wipes, perhaps minimizing microbial proliferation. The pillow surfaces had the highest counts of all surfaces sampled and are in close proximity with the moist wicking material, the plant and any plant debris which could facilitate inoculation and growth. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen in all cases. The genera of bacteria and fungi cultured and identified have also been identified in studies to monitor the microbial profiles of the ISS. Staphylococcus , Bacillus , Pantoea , Pseudomonas , Aspergillus and Penicillium were all identified in an examination of ISS air filters and dust samples [ 54 ]. Several of the same genera from the previous study were isolated and identified from the ISS vacuum cleaner bag, and also included Paenibacillus , Methylobacterium , Klebsiella , and Azospirillum [ 55 ]. In addition, studies done on the microbial communities associated with surfaces on the ISS identify many of the same genera identified from the Veggie surface samples collected in this study [ 30 , 32 ]. We compared bacterial genera from Avila-Herrera et al. [ 56 ] comprehensive characterization of ISS surface and crew samples with the Veggie facility surfaces and leaves characterized in the current study and found 250 genera shared between the Veggie facility surfaces and ISS samples. The leaves, Veggie surfaces and ISS samples had 47 common genera suggesting microbial transfer and colonization between these locations ( Figure S2 ). Beta diversity analysis of all plants grown in the three tech demos resulted in a tight clustering of plants from VEG-03D with the exception of one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities within VEG-03D. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences ( Figure 8 ). These differences could be the result of many factors, including the different configuration of the three crops in each Veggie, the environmental conditions present at the time of the grow-out, i.e., temperature, CO 2 and humidity, crew interaction, microbes present in the surrounding air, and irrigation water. Previous studies on field-grown leafy greens have shown that seasonal and temporal variation exists on the phyllosphere microbial communities, effected by leaf age, weather, location and soil type [ 14 , 15 , 57 ]. Unlike terrestrial agriculture, a sanitized, soilless substrate is used in Veggie to support root growth. It is aseptically packed into sterile “pillows” along with controlled release fertilizer [ 34 ]. The seeds are surface sanitized before planting, removing most epiphytes from the seed surface, and the water used to hydrate the plant pillows is relatively clean water from the ISS potable water system [ 35 , 58 ]. Consequently, the horticultural practices employed in Veggie may limit the sources of microbiota contributing to the development of the plant microbiome. As a whole, the phytomicrobiome is shaped and recruited by the plant from its associated habitat [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 59 ]. Rhizosphere microbiomes assemble through the selection of soil microorganisms by the production of plant root exudates [ 60 , 61 , 62 ]. The Veggie soilless substrate is essentially microbe free until the introduction of water, seed germination and exposure to the ISS environment. Water and air from the ISS have been monitored by NASA for many years and two genera commonly identified from the potable water are Burkholderia and Ralstonia [ 58 , 63 ]. The dominant bacterial genera in Veggie samples analyzed in this study, Burkholderia , was found across plant types and Veggie facility materials in both culture and molecular assays. The genus Burkholderia contains over 60 known species and was abundant in many of the Veggie samples, primarily in the pillow substrate, root tissue, and wicks, but in very low abundance or was absent in leaf tissue indicating the genus may have been introduced through the water source or possibly was present in the seed. Burkholderia has been identified as a potential, beneficial plant-associated microbe, however some species are implicated in human opportunistic infections [ 21 , 64 , 65 ] Ralstonia , also found in ISS water, was identified in community sequencing across all plant type roots, wicks, and substrate. Some species of Ralstonia have the potential to cause stress in plants or may be an opportunistic pathogen [ 66 , 67 , 68 ]. Pseudomonas sp., present in the top 15 genera in community sequencing in all samples but one mizuna plant and pillow from VEG-03E may be a saprophytic epi-endophyte on plant tissue [ 16 , 64 , 69 , 70 , 71 ]. It has been reported to be a potential promotor of plant growth by producing plant stimulating hormones as well as increasing disease resistance [ 71 ]. These demonstrations, D and F were completed in the same Veggie unit, SN 002, and therefore not surprising that similar microbes would be detected. Several genera were identified by sequencing in VEG-03D and F but not in E. The genera Enterobacter , Chitinophaga , Novosphingobium , and Bradyrhizobium are a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples. Chitinophaga sp., works with certain fungal species as an endosymbiont to enhance nutrient uptake and growth [ 66 , 72 ]. The presence of Chitinophaga could be correlated with stress conditions and environmental disturbances [ 66 , 72 ]. In VEG-03D Methylobacterium was identified in red romaine and mizuna while Janthinobacterium was isolated in red romaine only. Recently it was reported that 4 strains of Methylobacterium , one a newly characterized strain, were isolated on the ISS with the Microbial Monitoring experiments [ 73 ]. Methylobacterium are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens [ 74 , 75 ] and is a methylotrophic with the ability to utilize methanol produced by plants as a carbon source [ 76 ] Janthinobacterium is a soil bacterium with a wide range of metabolic activities, including antimicrobial properties and resistance to stressors such as UV radiation and cold temperatures providing a benefit to plants [ 77 , 78 , 79 ]. During the grow outs of VEG-03E and F, the genera Nevskia and Spirosoma were present in VEG-03E but not seen in VEG-03F. This could be due to a natural variation between mizuna and red romaine lettuce as each plant may have its own native microbiota, or it may have been introduced. These bacteria were detected in root and leaf samples from previous Veggie tech demos, VEG-01A, B and VEG-03A [ 28 ]. If the source of these bacteria is the water initially introduced into the soilless substrate and subsequently wicked to the seeds, this suggests possible mechanisms of transfer of water borne bacteria from the seed to the root or recruitment by the root from the surrounding substrate. An in-depth genomic analysis would have to be performed to elucidate possible sources of microbial transfer. All the bacteria cultured and identified from root samples, Burkholderia , Flavomonas , Leifsonia , Methylobacterium , Microbacterium and Rhizobium were also identified in the wick samples. Presumably, the sources of these bacteria are the ISS water, the endophytic seed population, circulating air, and/or human interaction with the plants, therefore diversity of the root microbiome could be limited by the populations in these sources. Eleven of the 12 identified isolates found on the leaf samples were not isolated from the roots, in corroboration with the 16S rRNA analysis of community comparison which revealed no shared species between the leaf and root. In the culture-based assays, 6 of the leaf-isolated bacteria were also found on the wicks. Different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities [ 80 , 81 ]. Patterns of genera common across the substrate, root, wicks, and leaves suggest alternate modes of bacterial and fungal transmission. For example, the substrate, roots, and wicks share the highest number of genera for all pillow sample sets tested while the leaves share a higher number of genera with the wicking material ( Figure 9 ). This suggests the possibility of horizontal transfer of bacteria from substrate to root or the converse. The substrate starts as a sterile matrix therefore the introduction of microbes could be primarily limited to the ISS potable water, microbes within the ISS, those harbored on the Veggie surfaces, or the endophytic seed microbiota. The seed microbiome of two of the three crops, red romaine lettuce and mizuna mustard, have been investigated at KSC in numerous studies since the inception of the Veggie technology demonstrations. The microbiome of both sanitized and unsanitized seeds indicated that in all seeds, abundance of microbial communities/genera was low and the genus Thermogemmatispora predominated, and then declined post-germination., In addition, Trichodesmium and some genera of cyanobacteria were detected along with low abundance of Burkholderia , Acinetobacter , and Corynebacterium . These latter three appear to persist in the plants after germination [ 82 ]. Very few genera are shared between the leaf and substrate and the leaf and root whereas the wick has more genera in common with the leaf than the substrate and root, indicating a vertical transfer from the above “ground” wick material and the shoot of the plant. Resident microbial populations on the leaf may be transported from the ISS environment, including the circulating air and human interaction. Human associated Staphylococcus was identified on the leaves, surfaces, and wicks from cultured isolates and for 16S community sequencing, it was the dominant bacteria among the top 15 identified in one VEG-03E mizuna leaf sample. Other potential human and plant associated bacterial genera identified were Erwinia, Burkholderia , and Clavibacter. Extensive genotyping of these isolates would be required to evaluate the strain and the ability to infect the host. Four of the fungal species identified, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum , Penicillium spp., Rhodotorula spp. were found in all tech demos. In previous studies of Veggie-grown plants, Fusarium oxysporum was not found on the first growth of lettuce or surfaces of Veggie from the tech demo designated VEG-01A but has since been isolated in all subsequent tech demos [ 28 ] (unpublished data). This suggests that once bacteria or fungi become established in Veggie units and the ISS environment, unless eliminated by the cleaning and maintenance protocols, they could persist as members of the facility microbiome and consequently the plant microbiome. In conclusion, characterization of the microbiome of ISS plant growth systems and crops is critical, not only for near term assurance of crop food safety, but also for the understanding and development of sustainable crop systems for space exploration missions. Sources of external contamination, i.e., irrigation water, air, and human handling can be monitored and controlled. Strategies, such as the introduction of defined beneficial microbes to enhance plant growth and prevent human and plant pathogen invaders may need to be evaluated and implemented after careful study of the impact to these unique space agricultural systems.",
