    "Results": "ER stress induces accumulation of superoxide by NADPH Oxidases We first aimed to test whether ER stress activates NADPH Oxidases by establishing the levels of O 2 − , the product of NADPH Oxidases, in seedlings subjected to induced ER stress conditions. To do so, we followed O 2 − accumulation in situ using nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT), a chromogenic substrate for oxidases commonly applied to the study of NADPH Oxidase activity in vivo ( Dunand et al. 2007 ). We analyzed roots of wild type (WT) and a double RBOHD and RBOHF knockout seedlings (herein dubbed rbohd rbohf ( Torres et al. 2002 )). RBOHD and RBOHF belong to a ten-member family of proteins and are mainly expressed in the shoot and vascular tissue ( Morales et al. 2016 ) After 7 days of growth on solid ½ LS media, the seedlings were transferred to solid ½ LS media containing the well-established ER stress inducer tunicamycin (Tm) for 24 or 48 hours to induce the adaptive UPR in a plate system ( Iwata et al. 2005 , Liu et al. 2007a , Chen et al. 2013 ).. We found that at 24 hours, the levels of NBT staining were only slightly increased, mainly at the root tip, both in Tm-treated WT and rbohd rbohf compared to the respective DMSO controls (Tm solvent) ( Figure 1A ; root tip indicated with Δ). However, at 48 hours of TM treatment, in WT and in the rbohd rbohf line the levels of NBT staining had dissipated at the root tip and increased along the maturation zone and mature root tissues ( Figure 1A ; mature zone and maturation zone indicated with † and ‡, respectively). The NBT staining was higher in the mature zone of WT roots compared to rbohd rbohf . These observations were validated by measurements of the relative levels of NBT staining along the root length using ImageJ ( Figure 1B ). These verified differences in NBT staining at the tissue level are consistent with the notion that RBOHD and RBOHF are expressed largely in shoot tissues and mature root tissues but not at the root tip in Arabidopsis ( Morales et al. 2016 ). We next tested whether the observed NBT staining in rbohd rbohf could be due to other RBOH activity. Therefore, we supplemented the Tm-treated samples with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a broad spectrum flavoprotein inhibitor that is commonly applied in the study of RBOH proteins ( Ogasawara et al. 2008 ). We found that DPI-treatment largely ablated the Tm-induced NBT-staining in WT and rbohd rbohf ( Figure 1A,B ). These results indicate that the remaining Tm-induced NBT staining found at the root tips may be sourced from the activity of RBOH other enzymes functioning redundantly to RBOHD and RBOHF ( Huang et al. 2016 ). Together, these results indicate that RBOHD, RBOHF, and potentially other RBOH enzymes are involved in ER stress-induced O 2 − production, which at least for RBOHD and RBOHF is with the previously described expression pattern at the tissue level.

Tissue-specific differences in superoxide are shown by relative pixel intensities of NBT stain from the root tip ± SE. ER stress induces the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide dependent upon RBOHD and RBOHF activity and intact UPR signaling Because O 2 − is converted to H 2 O 2 , we next aimed to establish the levels of accumulation of H 2 O 2 in seedlings undergoing ER stress. To do so, we first set up an assay to measure reliably H 2 O 2 levels in untreated tissues. We utilized a sensitive enzymatic fluorimetric assay based on the stoichiometric oxidization of non-fluorescent Amplex Ultra Red (AUR) by H 2 O 2 by exogenous horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to brightly fluorescent resorufin ( Queval et al. 2008 , Zhu et al. 2010 , Chakraborty et al. 2016 ). We expected that this assay would lead to the detection of resorufin fluorescence in the presence of HRP and to reduced levels of resorufin fluorescence in the absence of this enzyme. We first conducted tissue extraction using potassium phosphate buffer ( Chakraborty et al. 2016 , Le et al. 2016 ), and found no significant differences in oxidization of non-fluorescent AUR by added HRP compared to the control ( Figure 2A ). These results indicate either that the assay was not sensitive enough or that the AUR oxidation was saturated in the absence of HRP. To test this, we implemented a 10% trichloroacetic acid extraction (neutralized: NTCA) to precipitate possibly interfering enzymatic reactions, and then assayed the levels of H 2 O 2 . Consistent with our original hypothesis, we found that, in the presence of HRP, the levels of resorufin fluorescence were significantly higher than in the absence of the enzyme compared to the control ( Figure 2A ). As a further control for the validity of our assay, we treated the samples with catalase, which specifically dismutates H 2 O 2 in the extract and should therefore further lower the levels of resorufin fluorescence in HRP-treated samples. Conversely, we expected no differences in catalase treatment of samples extracted in potassium phosphate buffer compared the untreated control. In samples extracted with NTCA, we found that the levels of resorufin fluorescence were significantly lower in catalase-treated samples compared untreated samples ( Figure 2C ). As expected also, the addition of catalase did not alter the levels of fluorescence of potassium phosphate buffer-extracted samples compared to untreated samples ( Figure 2B ). These results support that the resorufin fluorescence levels detected in the potassium phosphate buffer-extracted samples are due to H 2 O 2 -independent oxidation of AUR. Importantly, these results also indicate that we have established a quantitative approach to track specifically H 2 O 2 levels in tissues. Figure 2.

WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b , and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings were treated in a plate system with Tm or DMSO for the indicated time and H 2 O 2 quantified; see materials and methods.

Statistical significance determined using Student’s unpaired t-test and indicated by: *=p<0.05, **=p<0.005 ***=p<0.0005, NS=not significant. We then used this assay to measure the levels of H 2 O 2 in seedlings experiencing ER stress during the adaptive phase of the UPR. Using the same plate system detailed earlier ( Figure 1 ), we compared the effects of Tm treatment for 6, 24, and 48 hours against seedlings growing on plates containing DMSO as control. We tested WT, rbohd rbohf , a mutant lacking the two IRE1 isoforms ( ire1a ire1b ; ( Chen et al. 2012 )) and a double mutant lacking functional bZIP60 and bZIP28 transcription factors ( bzip60 bzip28 ; ( Deng et al. 2013 )). We found differences in H 2 O 2 concentrations among the various backgrounds and their controls ( Figure 2D ), in support of a significant bearing of RBOHD and RBOHF activity as well as intact UPR on H 2 O 2 production. To better illustrate such differences we estimated the fold change in concentration between Tm/DMSO ( Figure 2E ). Specifically, we found that in all backgrounds at 6-hours of treatment there were no differences in fold change of H 2 O 2 concentrations (TM/DMSO; Figure 2E ). At 24 hours, we established that Tm-treatment led to a small but significant increase in H 2 O 2 levels in the ire1a ire1b mutant background only. However, at 48 hours, coincident with significant increases in O 2 − in mature WT tissues ( Figure 1B ), we found a significant increase in H 2 O 2 levels in WT that were not observed in the rbohd rbohf mutant ( Figure 2E ), indicating that RBOHD and RBOHF are required for the accumulation of H 2 O 2 under ER stress conditions. Noticeably, the increase of H 2 O 2 verified in WT but not rbohd rbohf was significantly greater in ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants ( Figure 2E ), supporting a requirement of an intact UPR signaling for the management of H 2 O 2 levels in conditions of ER stress. Together, these results indicate that H 2 O 2 accumulates in response to ER stress in the adaptive phase of the UPR dependent on RBOHD and RBOHF activity and also influenced by the integrity of UPR signaling. UPR regulators influence RBOHD and RBOHF expression during adaptive UPR Having established that RBOHD and RBOHF activity is required for ER stress-induced O 2 − and H 2 O 2 production (Figures 1 , 2 ), we next aimed to determine if the canonical UPR arms affected RBOHD or RBOHF expression at the transcriptional level. Therefore, we tested whether ER stress modulated RBOHF or RBOHD transcript levels as it occurs for other ER stress responsive genes, such as bZIP60 , BiP3 , ERdj3A and ERdj3B ( Chen et al. 2012 , Ruberti et al. 2018 ). To do so, a subset of seedlings from the H 2 O 2 quantification experiments ( Figure 2 ) were used to follow the changes in gene transcript levels by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) during Tm treatment in the plate system ( Iwata et al. 2005 , Liu et al. 2007a , Chen et al. 2013 ). We found no changes in the RBOHF transcript levels in the WT, ire1a ire1b , or bzip60 bzip28 lines at 6 hours of treatment. However, at 24 and 48 hours of TM treatment, the bzip60 bzip28 line had slightly lower levels of the RBOHF transcripts compared to WT ( Figure 3A ). Conversely, in the WT and ire1a ire1b , the RBOHD transcripts were transiently induced at 24 hours and then restored to basal levels at 48 hours. We also observed that the RBOHD induction was significantly higher in ire1a ire1b compared to WT ( Figure 3B ). The RBOHD transcript levels in the bzip60 bzip28 line we found to be slightly repressed at 6 hours of treatment (with a TM/DMSO ratio of ~0.8; Figure 3B ). Noticeably, however, at 24 hours in the bzip60 bzip28 line the RBOHD transcript levels were significantly lower compared to WT and ire1a ire1b . Together these results demonstrate that although the integrity of UPR signaling is required for maintaining homeostatic levels of RBOH expression during ER stress, the timing of the observed changes does not directly correlate with RBOHD and RBOHF dependent O 2 − ( Figure 1 ) or H 2 O 2 production ( Figure 2 ) in WT plants. This indicates that other factors, such as post translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, or altered endomembrane trafficking of the protein product may contribute to these outcomes. Figure 3. Intact UPR signaling is required to maintain homeostasis of RBOH transcript levels and ROS signaling, while RBOH activity affects UPR homeostasis. Open in a new tab Time course gene expression analysis of WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings subjected to ER stress . qRT-PCR analyses were performed using primers specific for either RBOHF (A), RBOHD (B), ZAT12 (C), spliced bZIP60 ( sbZIP60; D), BIP3 (E) , or ERdj3B (E). Data represent the mean ratio ± SE (biological replicates=3); Statistical significance compared to equivalent WT value, unless a bracket is used to indicate comparison. Statistical significance determined using Student’s unpaired t-test and indicated by: *=p<0.05, **=p<0.005 ***=p<0.005, NS=not significant. To provide further evidence that the observed increases in O 2 − ( Figure 1 ) are dependent upon RBOHD and RBOHF activity during ER stress, we quantified the expression of ZAT12 , an O 2 − responsive marker gene ( Miller et al. 2009 , Xu et al. 2017 ). Consistent with transiently increased levels of NBT staining at 24 hours in the root tip, which was largely independent of RBOHD and RBOHF activity ( Figure 1A ), we found a 6-fold upregulation in ZAT12 levels in the WT and rbohd rbohf lines ( Figure 3C ). Significantly at 48 hours, where we observed an increase in NBT staining of mature root tissues and upregulated H 2 O 2 levels in WT but not rbohd rbohf seedlings (Figures 1 , 2 ), we also found that rbohd rbohf seedlings had significantly lower levels of ZAT12 transcript ( Figure 3C ). These results demonstrate that 48 hours of ER stress induces O 2 − accumulation via RBOHD and RBOHF ( Figure 1 ) to a level that elicits a transcriptional response. We next aimed to test whether UPR regulation of RBOHD and RBOHF transcripts or H 2 O 2 levels (Figures 2 , 3A, 3B ) was correlated with changes in superoxide-dependent signaling. We found that at 6 hours of Tm treatment in ire1a ire1b the levels of ZAT12 were significantly higher compared to WT. At 24 hours of treatment, ZAT12 levels in bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants were slightly lower and higher than WT levels, respectively. Conversely, at 48 hours of treatment ZAT12 levels in bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants were higher and lower than WT levels, respectively ( Figure 3C ). Although the increased ZAT12 levels in the ire1a ire1b mutant are consistent with the verified increase in transcription of RBOHD and H 2 O 2 accumulation at 24 hours, the regulation of ZAT12 in both UPR mutant lines does not correlate with the RBOH transcription, or H 2 O 2 accumulation at 48 hours. We therefore propose that an impaired UPR response likely has pleiotropic effects in the regulation of superoxide production, superoxide signaling, and H 2 O 2 accumulation during adaptation to ER stress. We next tested whether impaired RBOHD and RBOHF activity affected the canonical UPR at a transcriptional level. We tested the levels of ER stress-responsive genes such as spliced bZIP60 transcripts ( sbZIP60) and BIP3 , whose abundance is primarily regulated by IRE1-bZIP60, as well as ERDJ3B, whose expression is primarily regulated by bZIP28 ( Ruberti et al., 2018 ). In WT, we found that the Tm treatment led to increased levels of sbZIP60 transcripts at 6 hrs, which were attenuated at 24 and 48 hours ( Figure 3D ). Compared to WT, in the rbohd robhf line, we observed no significant changes in the induction of sbZIP60 levels at 6 hours but a significant ~2 fold reduction of sbZIP60 levels at 48 hours ( Figure 3D ). An altered UPR signaling in rbohd rbohf was reflected in our analyses of BIP3 transcript levels, which were ~2-fold higher at 6 hours of treatment and ~4 fold lower at 48 hours in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT ( Figure 3E ). Conversely, ERdj3B was found to be ~1.2-fold lower at 6 hours in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT, but was otherwise insignificantly different. Taken together, these results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF contribute to maintain UPR signaling homeostasis during ER stress. RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary for recovery from short-term and chronic ER stress We next aimed to test whether RBOHD and RBOHF could contribute to ER stress resolution in situations subsequent to the adaptive phase. In this context, progression of the plant UPR has been studied in conditions of relief from ER stress (temporary ER stress; ( Ruberti et al. 2018 )) and in conditions of unresolved ER stress (chronic ER stress; ( Chen et al. 2013 )). Therefore, we first tested the role of RBOHD and RBOHF in recovery from temporary ER stress. In this assay, 7-day old-seedlings are transferred to liquid media containing Tm for 6 hrs, and then re-plated on growth medium without Tm. After 3 further days of growth, shoot fresh weight, root length and chlorophyll content are assayed to assess the ability of the various genetic backgrounds to overcome ER stress upon relief from an ER stress inducer. For the assay, we used WT, rbohd rbohf and ire1a ire1b . Consistent with previous findings ( Ruberti et al. 2018 ), at the completion of the recovery phase, we found that the shoots of the ire1a ire1b mutant weighed significantly less that DMSO-treated controls and lost most of their chlorophyll; the root also ceased further growth ( Figure 4A–D ). We also found that although the shoots of the Tm-treated rbohd rbohf plants weighed similarly to the Tm-treated WT ( Figure 4B ), a significant reduction of chlorophyll content was evident ( Figure 4C ). The roots of Tm-treated rbohd rbohf also showed an overall reduction in length compared to WT ( Figure 4D ). These results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to successfully overcome temporary ER stress. Figure 4. RBOHD and RBOHF are required in the recovery from temporary ER stress. Open in a new tab Phenotypic analyses of the various genetic backgrounds subjected to temporary ER stress . A. WT, rbohd rbohf , and ire1a ire1b seedlings were subjected to ER stress and were imaged after a 3 day recovery. From the seedlings grown in (A) shoot fresh weight (B), average total chlorophyll (C), and root length (D), were recorded as described in the materials and methods. Data represent the mean ± SE. (at least 10 biological replicates). Letters above each data point indicate statistically significant groups using Student’s unpaired t-test (p<0.05). We then tested the requirement of RBOHD and RBOHF for overcoming chronic ER stress. To do so, we followed the customary approach to germinate seeds on growth medium containing Tm for comparison with seedlings germinated on control plates ( Chen et al. 2012 ). As positive controls, we again used ire1a ire1b as well as bzip60 bzip28 , which are hypersensitive to chronic ER stress ( Liu et al. 2007a , Chen et al. 2012 ). After fourteen days of growth, we examined shoot fresh weight and chlorophyll content ( Figure 5A–C ). Consistent with previous findings ( Chen et al. 2012 , Ruberti et al. 2018 ), the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants showed a strong phenotype with marked reduction in shoot fresh weight and loss of chlorophyll content. When we analyzed rbohd rbohf , we found a significant reduction in the average shoot fresh weight and chlorophyll content compared to WT. These results indicate that, similar to temporary ER stress recovery, RBOHD and RBOHF are required to successfully overcome chronic ER stress. Figure 5. RBOHD and RBOHF are required for adaptation to chronic ER stress. Open in a new tab Phenotypic analysis of different seedling genetic backgrounds subjected to chronic ER stress . A. WT, rbohd rbohf , ire1a ire1b , and bzip60 bzip28 were germinated on media containing the indicated concentration of Tm or DMSO grown for two weeks. Shoots fresh weight (B) and total chlorophyll content (C) were measured. Data represent the mean ± SE (at least 10 biological replicates). Letters above each data point indicate statistically significant groups using Student’s unpaired t-test (p<0.05). RBOHD and RBOHF contribute to preventing ER stress induced cell death Previous reports have detailed the protective role that RBOHD and RBOHF play in preventing the spread of cell death during plant immune system response through yet undetermined mechanisms ( Torres et al. 2005 ). Having established that RBOHD and RBOHF are required for successful recovery from temporary ER stress and survival from chronic ER stress, we postulated that these enzymes could be involved in mechanisms preventing cell death caused by ER stress. To test this hypothesis, we followed cell death by quantification of electrolyte leakage ( Lee et al. 2010 ) in WT, rbohd rbohf, ire1a ire1b , and bzip60 bzip28 seedlings exposed to Tm for two and six days ( Figure 6A,B ). We found that although the shoot and root of Tm-treated WT seedlings grew considerably less compared to DMSO control, no significant differences were detected in electrolyte leakage levels ( Figure 6B ). As expected, the bzip60 bzip28 and ire1a ire1b mutants showed considerable chlorophyll loss with electrolyte leakage reaching almost 50% at 6 days of Tm treatment. We found that rbohd rbohf plants also showed a significant chlorophyll loss and electrolyte leakage by 6 days of Tm-treatment ( Figure 6B ) compared to WT plants. These results indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF contribute in preventing cell death in ER stress conditions. Figure 6. RBOHD and RBOHF act to prevent ER stress induced cell death.

    "Conclusion": "In plants, the identity of several critical sensors and transducers of ER stress has been unraveled ( Angelos et al. 2017 ), and the challenge ahead is to discover additional factors that participate in the UPR management. In this work, we have established that two NADPH Oxidases are necessary to overcome specific situations of ER stress, such as recovery from ER stress conditions and unresolved ER stress. These results enrich the general knowledge of the identity of the proteins and signaling pathways that contribute to ER stress survival in plants. The ability of mammalian cells to overcome ER stress is negatively influenced by NADPH Oxidases-produced ROS ( Li et al. 2010 ). In plants, the relationship between ROS and the UPR was unknown. In this work, we showed that, in conditions of an intact UPR signaling, NADPH Oxidases-produced ROS exert a positive role on the ability of the plant to overcome ER stress. These findings support the conclusion that, despite the functional conservation of canonical ER stress sensors and transducers such as IRE1 and bZIP-transcription factors, plants have evolved unique strategies for ER stress survival. NADPH Oxidases contribute to ROS production in conditions of ER stress Several metabolic and signaling processes affect cellular concentrations of H 2 O 2 in plants, including biotic and abiotic stress responses ( Miller et al. 2009 ), nutrient availability ( Contento et al. 2010 ), circadian rhythms ( Zhong et al. 1994 ), and gravity ( Hausmann et al. 2014 ). In Arabidopsis there are also studies indicating that ER stress affects cellular concentrations of H 2 O 2 , through both direct measurements ( Ozgur et al. 2014 , Ozgur et al. 2018 ) and analyses of redox-related biochemical activities that are intimately linked with cellular H 2 O 2 levels ( Ozgur et al. 2014 ). However, prior to our work the nature of the enzymes contributing to H 2 O 2 levels in conditions of ER stress had yet to be clearly established in plants. In this work, we have set up a sensitive assay to measure H 2 O 2 levels ( Figure 2 ). Using this assay, superoxide staining and a genetic background lacking RBOHD and RBOHF, we showed that ER stress causes activation of NADPH Oxidase-coupled superoxide production, leading to the accumulation of H 2 O 2 (Figures 1 , 2 ). We further show that a superoxide-responsive signaling pathway ( Xu et al. 2017 ) is also activated, as demonstrated by transcriptional induction of the marker gene ZAT12 ( Figure 3C ). The concomitant reduction of three different ROS reporters in the rbohd rbohf line compared to WT under conditions of ER stress (Figures 1 , 2 , 3 ; 48 hours) supports that the elevation of H 2 O 2 in conditions of stress is contributed partially by RBOHD and RBOHF. Therefore, these findings identify two of the enzymes that operate in ROS management during ER stress potentially sharing redundant functions with other RBOH-enzymes. Although, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to activation of these enzymes in response to ER stress have yet to be elucidated, a regulation of RBOH enzymes by altered cytosolic calcium levels and association with G-protein signaling components may be postulated as contributing factors. In metazoans cellular calcium ion homeostasis is intimately linked with ER stress, as calcium is required for the proper functioning of ER luminal foldase activities ( Krebs et al. 2015 ). Inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) transporters leads to the induction of ER stress and the UPR ( Krebs et al. 2015 ). Upon prolonged UPR activation, a number of factors, including ER lumen hyper-oxidation by ER oxidase 1a (ERO1a), leads to calcium release from the ER through activation of inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3R) and apoptotic events ( Sovolyova et al. 2014 ). Although IP3R-like ER calcium channels have yet to be identified in plants, SERCA-like transporters have been identified ( Liang et al. 1997 ). Therefore it is possible that ER stress/UPR induction could alter ER and cytosolic calcium levels, which can promote RBOHD activation ( Ogasawara et al. 2008 ). Furthermore, in plant responses to bacterial pathogen attack, it has also been demonstrated that a null mutation in the Arabidopsis Gβ subunit ( agb1) of the heterotrimeric G-protein plasma membrane signaling complex was epistatic to the rbohd rbohf null mutation( Torres et al. 2013 ). The AGB1 gene acts in concert with receptor-like kinases to mediate oxidative burst response to pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity( Liu et al. 2013 , Liu et al. 2016b ). Although it is yet to be tested whether AGB1 interacts genetically with RBOHD and RBOHF in ER stress, similar to rbohd rbohf, agb1 is sensitive to chronic ER stress ( Chen et al. 2012 ). It is therefore possible that AGB1 may contribute to RBOH signaling in conditions of ER stress. Unlike in metazoans, NADPH Oxidase-produced ROS are beneficial to overcome ER stress in plants Many aspects of the UPR regulators are conserved between plants and metazoans at a functional level even when compared to yeast wherein only IRE1 arm of the UPR is genetically encoded ( Ron et al. 2007 , Ruberti et al. 2015 , Liu et al. 2016a ). However, it is increasingly obvious that the different evolutionary contexts between plants and animals have forced the development of different survival strategies in overcoming ER stress. The lack of a plant homolog of the mammalian PERK UPR pathway is evidence to that effect. NADPH Oxidases are largely conserved between mammals and plants ( Suzuki et al. 2011 ). However, the activities of mammalian NADPH Oxidase 2 (Nox2) and NADPH Oxidase 4 (Nox4), two homologs of RBOHD and RBOHF, promote apoptosis during ER stress ( Pedruzzi et al. 2004 , Li et al. 2010 ). Specifically, an intravenous tunicamycin challenge in Nox2−/− mice resulted in a dramatic reduction of renal cell apoptosis and increased protection against renal dysfunction when compared to WT mice ( Li et al. 2010 ). In this work, we show that rbohd rbohf plants display a significant sensitivity to ER stress conditions (Figures 4 , 5 , 6 ). Specifically, in the recovery from acute Tm treatment, in rbohd rbohf , the resumption of plant growth is markedly delayed, and under chronic stress conditions (Figures 5 , 6 ), rbohd rbohf plants exhibit enhanced progression of cell death ( Figure 6 ). Therefore, differently from the mammalian system, during ER stress NADPH Oxidases RBOHD and RBOHF exert a pro-survival role in the ER stress response. As such, the results presented in this study identify RBOHD and RBOHF as important positive contributors to UPR adaptation in plants in a manner that runs differently from the mammalian cell system. Homeostasis of NADPH Oxidase activity is required to maintain an effective UPR Several studies, including studies of RBOH activity during heat stress response in plants, support a non-specific “transcriptional priming” by which fast acting ROS production by RBOHD amplifies initial stress-specific transcriptional responses in local and systemic tissues ( Mittler et al. 2015 ). In our analyses, we established that the RBOHD and RBOHF are involved in the adaptive phase of the UPR ( Figure 3D–F ) as well as in recovery from temporary ER stress and in situations of chronic ER stress (Figures 4 , 5 ). Consistent with a priming role of RBOH activity in stress responses, the verified misregulation of the adaptive phase of the UPR due to a compromised RBOH activity may lead to a defective actuation of proper cytoprotective responses necessary for surviving temporary and chronic ER stress. Interestingly, when compared to ERdj3B levels, we verified a stronger impact on the induction levels of sbZIP60 and BIP3 in rbohd rbohf compared to WT ( Figure 3D–E ). Based on the findings that BIP3 expression is principally controlled by the IRE1-bZIP60 arm and that the ERdj3B is principally controlled by bZIP28 arm, we propose that the activity of RBOHD and RBOHF positively influences the transcriptional role of bZIP60. This hypothesis does not exclude that other RBOH enzymes may affect the transcriptional role of bZIP60 as well as bZIP28. Indeed, in our work, while we demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF activity is required for successfully overcoming these specific conditions of ER stress, the activity of these enzymes is not strictly essential. This is supported by the relative survival of rbohd rbohf compared to ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 in temporary and chronic ER stress conditions (Figures 4 , 5 , 6 ). Given the relatively large size of RBOH family and the residual NADPH Oxidase marker activity observed in the rbohd rbohf line ( Figure 1 ), it is possible that RBOHD and RBOHF share redundant activity with other RBOH enzymes in temporary and chronic ER stress conditions. In ER stress conditions, the production of ROS is antagonized by IRE1 and the bZIP60/bZIP28 transcription factors The plant IRE1 as well as the availability of bZIP28 and bZIP60 together are strictly necessary to overcome temporary and prolonged stress, as demonstrated by the evidence that death is accelerated in the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants compared to WT in situations of recovery from temporary ER stress or in conditions of chronic ER stress (( Nagashima et al. 2011 , Chen et al. 2012 , Deng et al. 2013 , Liu et al. 2016a ); Figures 4 , 5 ). An analysis of ER stress response in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reported a significant transcriptional induction of ROS-dependent marker genes in IRE1 knockouts ( Yamaoka et al. 2018 ). These findings led to the hypothesis that an increase in ROS may contribute to the ER stress sensitivity of ire1 knockout lines in this model systems ( Yamaoka et al. 2018 ). Our results that in the Arabidopsis ire1a ire1b line, which is hypersensitive to ER stress (( Chen et al. 2012 ); Figures 4 – 6 ), the H 2 O 2 levels are higher at 24 and 48 hours of Tm treatment compared to WT ( Figure 2E ) corroborate this hypothesis. Our results also provide direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that UPR regulators are required to manage cellular H 2 O 2 concentrations under ER stress conditions in plants like they do in metazoans ( Hourihan et al. 2016 ). However, the verified increases in H 2 O 2 content in the ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants were not directly correlated with the observed misregulation of ZAT12/RBOHD transcript levels in these lines compared to WT, which may indicate that an intact UPR signaling potentially coordinates ROS production/signaling through multiple mechanisms to promote proper ER stress management. Conversely, the verified differences in transcript induction of UPR marker genes (i.e., sbZIP60 , BIP3 and ERdj3B ) in rbohd rbohf compared to WT ( Figure 3D–E ) indicate that RBOH activity is required to maintain proper UPR signaling. How the observed increase in H 2 O 2 levels may affect the UPR is yet undetermined at a mechanistic level. Recent findings have shown that ER stress alters the cytosolic redox potential, which in turn modulates the activity of the transcriptional coregulatory NPR1 (nonexpresser of PR genes), which binds and represses the transcriptional function of bZIP28 and bZIP60 ( Lai et al. 2018 ). It is similarly possible that an excessive elevation of H 2 O 2 in conditions of ER stress changes the activity of UPR and programmed cell death modulators. The ROS species produced by RBOHD and RBOHF suppress the spread of runaway cell death in a pathway parallel to the Lesion Stimulating Disease 1 (LSD1) zinc-finger protein under normal growth conditions, in response to salicylic acid, extracellular superoxide, and pathogen induced hypersensitive response ( Torres et al. 2005 ). The results of our study indicate that RBOHD and RBOHF may also prevent the propagation of cell death in response to chronic ER stress ( Figure 6 ). Under this light, the noted misregulation of RBOH activity and accumulation of H 2 O 2 in ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants during ER stress (Figures 2E , 3C ) may represent convergent signals that initiate processes leading toward programmed cell death, and could at least partially explain the hypersensitivity of these lines to ER stress conditions ( Figure 4 – 6 ) ( Chen et al. 2012 , Deng et al. 2013 ). Therefore, together our results support the hypothesis for a dual role of H 2 O 2 in ER stress-induced programmed cell death, which is differently manifested in WT and mutants of the UPR signaling pathway. Specifically, in cells with an intact UPR, RBOH activity and H 2 O 2 levels are maintained to levels that promote survival; however, a defective UPR likely causes misregulation of RBOH activity and excess H 2 O 2 accumulation that may lead to cell death. The latter scenario may be beneficial for plants to favor the survival only of cells with an intact ability to overcome proteotoxic stress.",
