    "Abstract": "Abstract Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum . The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11 T . Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C 18 : 1 −ω7 c and C 18 : 1 −ω6 c . The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium , and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2 T (NRRL B-65601 T and LMG 32165 T ). Keywords: Methylobacterium , polyphasic taxomony, ANI, international space station (ISS), whole genome sequencing",
    "Results": "This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae , collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1-R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only. Phylogenetic Analysis of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that three of the ISS strains (IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) belong to a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium . The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly described Methylobacterium species was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and <97.3% for gyrB gene with the closest being M. indicum SE2.11 T . Phylogenetic analysis of these three ISS strains was carried out by constructing a maximum likelihood tree based on 16S rRNA ( Figure 1 ), gyrB ( Figure 2 ), atpD ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), recA ( Supplementary Figure 2 ), dnaK ( Supplementary Figure 3 ), rpoB ( Supplementary Figure 4 ), and glnI ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) gene sequences. In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually ( Figure 3 ). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated ( Figure 4 ). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) are clustered together and in the same clade with M. indicum SE2.11 T . The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing, housekeeping gene-based analyses, MLSA, and genome-based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related to M. indicum . In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1-R3 was further confirmed to be M. rhodesianum based on its 16S rRNA gene ( Figure 1 ) and gyrB ( Figure 2 ) phylogenetic affiliation to the type strain M. rhodesianum DSM 5687 T .

Whole Genome Sequence–Based Phylogenetic Analysis The genomes of the four isolated ISS strains were sequenced, with their draft genome assembled and annotated. The results are summarized in Table 1 . The genome varied in size from 6.1 to 6.8 Mbp with GC content between 68 and 71%, similar to other members of the family Methylobacteriaceae . TABLE 1.

The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) with M. indicum SE2.11 T were 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other Methylobacterium species were below the threshold of 95% ANI ( Yoon et al., 2017 ) and 70% dDDH values ( Auch et al., 2010 ), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus Methylobacterium . These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99–100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, M. indicum SE2.11 T , and M. platani PMB02 T were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system ( Kurtz et al., 2004 ). As shown in Supplementary Figure 6 , genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of M. indicum and M. platani exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW-B2 T . Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.

The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISS Methylobacterium strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains were ∼82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1-R3 as M. rhodesianum . In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented. Phenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 2 . The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 are listed in Table 3 , in comparison with other related Methylobacterium species. Three strains belonging to Methylobacterium sp. nov. are reddish pink–pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile, and rod-shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45°C. These strains were positive for assimilation of L -arabinose, D -glucose, maltose, D -mannitol, D -mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in Supplementary Tables 3-5 , respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other Methylobacterium species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relative M. indicum in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike M. indicum , these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other Methylobacterium species, M. aquaticum and M. terrae exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by M. aquaticum . Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by M. terrae cells. TABLE 3.

All strains exhibited 0-1% NaCl tolerance and were motile. *Growth was tested at 7, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C and cells were grown optimally at 25 and 30°C but no growth was observed at 7, 37, and 45°C. Growth lower than 25°C might be possible but not tested. The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus Methylobacterium , with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation ( Green and Bousfield, 1982 ). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS Methylobacterium strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus Methylobacterium . Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other Methylobacterium species. However, the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains differed from other members of the genus Methylobacterium in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown in Table 3 . For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the Methylobacterium species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related Methylobacterium species. Chemotaxonomic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The FAME profiling of three ISS strains and other related Methylobacterium species are given in Table 4 . The major fatty acids in these ISS strains were C 18 : 1 ω7 c and/or C 18 : 1 ω6 c (Sum in Feature 8; 82 to 85%) with small amounts of C 18 : 0 3-OH, C 16 : 0 , C 17 : 0 , Sum in Feature 3, Sum in Feature 2, C 18 : 0 and C 12 : 0 , and traces of C 11 : 0 , C 13 : 0 , and C 14 : 0 . The fatty acids, C 18 : 1 ω7 c and/or C 18 : 1 ω6 c , were observed to be dominant in these ISS strains, similar to other species. However, complete FAME profiles were not consistent among Methylobacterium species and some significant differences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed ( Table 4 ). The notable difference in the FAME profile was the lower abundance of C 18 : 1 ω7 c in M. indicum (46%) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85%). TABLE 4.

The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentified lipid ( Supplementary Figure 7 ). The total polar lipid profile of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with the results of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the affiliation of strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 to the genus Methylobacterium . Functional Characteristics of the Novel ISS Strain The genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T , type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described in Table 5 . All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented in Supplementary Data 1 . A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) ( Table 5 ). Genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed. TABLE 5.

Based on the genome annotation, genes for nitrogen metabolism were predicted in the genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T . Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria ( Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007 ). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high-affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T ( Wanner, 1993 , 1996 ). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T when compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; Methylobacterium sp. IF7SW-B2 T exhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified in Solibacillus kalamii ( Seuylemezian et al., 2017 ) and 18 features were identified in Kalamiella piersonii ( Singh et al., 2019 ). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions ( Orsini et al., 2017 ; Aunins et al., 2018 ). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self-sustainable plant crops for long-term space missions in future. Genes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain A thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T revealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase ( miaA ) essential for cytokinin production reported in M. aquaticum strain 22A ( Tani et al., 2015 ) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T with high similarity. The product of the miaA gene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specific adenine in some tRNAs and confirmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA in M. extorquens ( Koenig et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB, L -threonine 3-O-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate-nucleotide—dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T . The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented ( Supplementary Figure 8 ). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that Methylobacterium strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth ( Krug et al., 2020 ). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T and are listed in the Supplementary Figure 8 . Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in Methylobacterium spp. ( Krug et al., 2020 ). In the “carbon for iron mutualism” concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria ( Amin et al., 2015 ). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant-growth promoting activities in the IF7SW-B2 T ISS strain. In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized Methylobacterium species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 represent a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium , for which the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2 T (NRRL B-65601 T and LMG 32165 T ). Description of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii (aj.ma’li.i. N.L. gen. n. ajmalii named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase- and catalase-positive reactions. Cells are 1.6–1.8 μm wide and 2.2–3.2 μm long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink–pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6–1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar. Growth occurs at 25–30°C (optimum, 30°C), at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%). In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, D -glucose, D -maltose, D -mannitol, D -mannose, L-arabinose, Malic acid, N-acetyl-glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and D -melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 ω7 c and/or C18:1 ω6 c ). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G + C content of the type strain is 71.07 mol%. The type strain IF7SW-B2 T is isolated from the International Space Station.",
    "Conclusion": "This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae , collected from different locations on the ISS. Three of the strains, referred to as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, were identified based on the traditional and genomic taxonomic approaches. The fourth strain, which was isolated from a HEPA filter and referred to as I1-R3, was identified based on genomic analyses only. Phylogenetic Analysis of Novel ISS Strains To confirm that three of the ISS strains (IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) belong to a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium . The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly described Methylobacterium species was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and <97.3% for gyrB gene with the closest being M. indicum SE2.11 T . Phylogenetic analysis of these three ISS strains was carried out by constructing a maximum likelihood tree based on 16S rRNA ( Figure 1 ), gyrB ( Figure 2 ), atpD ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), recA ( Supplementary Figure 2 ), dnaK ( Supplementary Figure 3 ), rpoB ( Supplementary Figure 4 ), and glnI ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) gene sequences. In addition, MLSA was carried out by concatenating the six housekeeping genes manually ( Figure 3 ). In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on WGS was generated ( Figure 4 ). The phylogenetic trees constructed based on all these genes, MLSA, and WGS showed that these three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) are clustered together and in the same clade with M. indicum SE2.11 T . The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing, housekeeping gene-based analyses, MLSA, and genome-based tree further supported the concept that these three ISS strains belong to the same species but are closely related to M. indicum . In addition, the identity of the ISS strain I1-R3 was further confirmed to be M. rhodesianum based on its 16S rRNA gene ( Figure 1 ) and gyrB ( Figure 2 ) phylogenetic affiliation to the type strain M. rhodesianum DSM 5687 T .

Whole Genome Sequence–Based Phylogenetic Analysis The genomes of the four isolated ISS strains were sequenced, with their draft genome assembled and annotated. The results are summarized in Table 1 . The genome varied in size from 6.1 to 6.8 Mbp with GC content between 68 and 71%, similar to other members of the family Methylobacteriaceae . TABLE 1.

The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) with M. indicum SE2.11 T were 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other Methylobacterium species were below the threshold of 95% ANI ( Yoon et al., 2017 ) and 70% dDDH values ( Auch et al., 2010 ), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus Methylobacterium . These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99–100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, M. indicum SE2.11 T , and M. platani PMB02 T were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system ( Kurtz et al., 2004 ). As shown in Supplementary Figure 6 , genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of M. indicum and M. platani exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW-B2 T . Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.

The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISS Methylobacterium strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains were ∼82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1-R3 as M. rhodesianum . In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented. Phenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 2 . The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 are listed in Table 3 , in comparison with other related Methylobacterium species. Three strains belonging to Methylobacterium sp. nov. are reddish pink–pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile, and rod-shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45°C. These strains were positive for assimilation of L -arabinose, D -glucose, maltose, D -mannitol, D -mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in Supplementary Tables 3-5 , respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other Methylobacterium species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relative M. indicum in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike M. indicum , these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other Methylobacterium species, M. aquaticum and M. terrae exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by M. aquaticum . Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by M. terrae cells. TABLE 3.

All strains exhibited 0-1% NaCl tolerance and were motile. *Growth was tested at 7, 25, 30, 37, and 45°C and cells were grown optimally at 25 and 30°C but no growth was observed at 7, 37, and 45°C. Growth lower than 25°C might be possible but not tested. The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus Methylobacterium , with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation ( Green and Bousfield, 1982 ). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS Methylobacterium strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus Methylobacterium . Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other Methylobacterium species. However, the three novel ISS Methylobacterium strains differed from other members of the genus Methylobacterium in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown in Table 3 . For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the Methylobacterium species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related Methylobacterium species. Chemotaxonomic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains The FAME profiling of three ISS strains and other related Methylobacterium species are given in Table 4 . The major fatty acids in these ISS strains were C 18 : 1 ω7 c and/or C 18 : 1 ω6 c (Sum in Feature 8; 82 to 85%) with small amounts of C 18 : 0 3-OH, C 16 : 0 , C 17 : 0 , Sum in Feature 3, Sum in Feature 2, C 18 : 0 and C 12 : 0 , and traces of C 11 : 0 , C 13 : 0 , and C 14 : 0 . The fatty acids, C 18 : 1 ω7 c and/or C 18 : 1 ω6 c , were observed to be dominant in these ISS strains, similar to other species. However, complete FAME profiles were not consistent among Methylobacterium species and some significant differences in the proportions of certain fatty acids were observed ( Table 4 ). The notable difference in the FAME profile was the lower abundance of C 18 : 1 ω7 c in M. indicum (46%) when compared with these ISS strains (82 to 85%). TABLE 4.

Summed feature 2 (iso-C16:1 I and/or C14:0 3-OH), summed feature 3 (C16:1 ω7 c and/or C16:1 ω6 c ), Sum In Feature 5 comprises of C18:0-ω6,9c and ante-C18:0 and summed feature 8 (C18:1 ω7 c and/or C18:1ω6 c ). These ISS strains contained Q-10 as the major respiratory isoprenoid quinone, which is common in members of the genus Methylobacterium . The polar lipids present in these three strains were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl choline (PC), phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE), and an unidentified lipid ( Supplementary Figure 7 ). The total polar lipid profile of these ISS strains was consistent with their close relatives, predominated with phospholipids, DPG, PG, and PE. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic data together with the results of the genomic and phylogenetic analysis support the affiliation of strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 to the genus Methylobacterium . Functional Characteristics of the Novel ISS Strain The genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T , type strain, was annotated and analyzed to determine biotechnologically important genetic determinants. The whole genome and annotation analysis predicted a total of 6,531 genes in the assembled draft genome. Among these, 1,430 fell into various RAST categories, contributing to 2,067 predicted features described in Table 5 . All the 1,430 feature and subsystems have been documented in Supplementary Data 1 . A major fraction of the annotated genes was composed of amino acids and derivatives (408), carbohydrate metabolism (246), protein metabolism (198), genes associated with cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments metabolism (190), and respiration (151) ( Table 5 ). Genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis (95), metabolism of aromatic compounds (47), and stress response (72) were also observed. TABLE 5.

Based on the genome annotation, genes for nitrogen metabolism were predicted in the genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T . Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria ( Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007 ). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high-affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T ( Wanner, 1993 , 1996 ). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T when compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; Methylobacterium sp. IF7SW-B2 T exhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified in Solibacillus kalamii ( Seuylemezian et al., 2017 ) and 18 features were identified in Kalamiella piersonii ( Singh et al., 2019 ). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions ( Orsini et al., 2017 ; Aunins et al., 2018 ). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self-sustainable plant crops for long-term space missions in future. Genes Essential for Interaction With Plants in the ISS Strain A thorough genomic analysis of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T revealed the presence of genes that have been involved in promoting plant growth. The isopentenyl tRNA transferase ( miaA ) essential for cytokinin production reported in M. aquaticum strain 22A ( Tani et al., 2015 ) was also found in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T with high similarity. The product of the miaA gene was reported to be responsible for isopentenylation of a specific adenine in some tRNAs and confirmed the secretion of zeatin originated from tRNA in M. extorquens ( Koenig et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB, L -threonine 3-O-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate-nucleotide—dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T . The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented ( Supplementary Figure 8 ). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that Methylobacterium strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth ( Krug et al., 2020 ). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2 T and are listed in the Supplementary Figure 8 . Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in Methylobacterium spp. ( Krug et al., 2020 ). In the “carbon for iron mutualism” concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria ( Amin et al., 2015 ). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant-growth promoting activities in the IF7SW-B2 T ISS strain. In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized Methylobacterium species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 represent a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium , for which the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2 T (NRRL B-65601 T and LMG 32165 T ). Description of Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. Methylobacterium ajmalii (aj.ma’li.i. N.L. gen. n. ajmalii named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase- and catalase-positive reactions. Cells are 1.6–1.8 μm wide and 2.2–3.2 μm long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink–pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6–1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar. Growth occurs at 25–30°C (optimum, 30°C), at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%). In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, D -glucose, D -maltose, D -mannitol, D -mannose, L-arabinose, Malic acid, N-acetyl-glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and D -melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 ω7 c and/or C18:1 ω6 c ). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G + C content of the type strain is 71.07 mol%. The type strain IF7SW-B2 T is isolated from the International Space Station.",
